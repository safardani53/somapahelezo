Now, the series is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>available to stream on Netflix</a>, and fans — both new and old — can watch eight out of its nine seasons. Viewers can <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>watch season nine</a> on Peacock.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The series centers on a fictional New York City law firm and follows the exploits of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Patrick J. Adams</a>’ Mike Ross, who manages to talk his way into a job as a lawyer despite having never attended law school. Naturally, Mike spends a number of seasons hoping to keep his big secret to himself, but eventually, it comes out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the series ended in 2019, it’s still beloved by fans all over the world — and many are hoping for a reboot. In September 2023, when Adams shared <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>never-before-seen photos of Markle</a> on set, many Instagram users thought he might be hinting at a potential return to the offices of Pearson Hardman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cast of Suits is slated to reunite at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ATX TV Festival</a> in summer 2024. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Dulé Hill&nbsp;and the show’s creator, Aaron Korsh, are among the confirmed attendees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s where the cast of Suits are now and what they’ve been working on since the show concluded.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-meghan-markle-as-rachel-zane></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Meghan Markle as Rachel Zane</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Cinematic Collection / Alamy ; Dominic Lipinski - Pool/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Arguably the most famous cast member of Suits since the show’s ending, many people know that Meghan Markle left Suits to marry Prince Harry in 2018. Ahead of her departure, Markle’s character Rachel Zane was a fan favorite who finally tied the knot with Adams’ character at the end of season 7 before the pair moved on to new jobs in Seattle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2022, Markle revealed that she spent most of the first season waiting to be fired from the show. As she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety</a>, “For me, I had tried for so long to land on a show, filming all these pilots, wondering if they would get picked up. All of Season 1 on Suits, I was convinced I was going to get recast. All the time. It got to a point where the creator was like, ‘Why are you so worried about this?' ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clearly, Markle had nothing to worry about. After leaving Suits, she and Prince Harry went on to found their non-profit organization Archewell and have welcomed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>two children</a> together, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Prince Archie</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Princess Lilibet</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Markle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and she and Harry <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>left their royal duties</a> and returned to her home state, where they are raising their family in Montecito.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-patrick-j-adams-as-michael-ross></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Patrick J.

Adams' Mike Ross is hired on as an associate lawyer at Pearson Hardman despite the fact that he did not actually have a degree in law. As the character who is perhaps the most central to the show, Adams admitted to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Collider</a> that he didn’t exactly realize what he was taking on when he joined the show’s cast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When I joined Suits, I was so young and I didn’t really even know what was involved," he explained. "I didn’t know how much work it was. I didn’t know what that looked like over a long period of time. Not that I would have done anything differently but it certainly was a rude awakening to understand that level of commitment and hours, and the amount of time and energy and love that you have to pour into something like that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adams left the show, along with Markle, following season 7; he did, however, make <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>guest appearances</a> during the final season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Very excited to head back into the fray one last time. Thanks to the fans for keeping the flame alive and to Mr. Aaron Korsh for welcoming me back,” he wrote on Instagram at the time of the cameo.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adams was born in Toronto, Canada, and moved to L.A. when he was 19. He began acting after graduating from the University of Southern California and had a number of television roles in shows like Cold Case, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Friday Night Lights</a> and Legends of Tomorrow. He’s continued to act since Suits ended, having appeared in the miniseries The Right Stuff and starred in four episodes of the Amazon Prime series <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>A League of Their Own</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for his personal life, Adams is married to actress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Troian Bellisario</a>, and the couple share two daughters.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gabriel-macht-as-harvey-specter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gabriel Macht as Harvey Specter</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Album / Alamy ; Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Harvey Specter, a senior partner at Pearson Hardman, Gabriel Macht served as the center of nearly every plotline on Suits and was in every single episode of the series. Following Suits, Macht starred on the short-lives spin-off series Pearson but has not acted since.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In July 2023, Macht mentioned Suits in an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram post</a> after the show broke streaming records when it was released on Netflix. "I’m humbled that the stories we created and produced for 9 seasons have been watched and rewatched and will continue to create memories for all whose enjoy the fruits of our labor," he wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Macht was born and raised in N.Y.C. and grew up in the Bronx with his parents. Prior to getting the role of Specter on the series, he had mostly only acted in films; as Macht told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Harper’s Bazaar</a> in March 2017, he had to take a different approach to playing a character on TV.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“With a series, it's slow turns and slow deepening of a character, and when I first approached it, I started to have Harvey change within the first season. I had to pull the brakes, because if you do it that quickly then you have nowhere to go after the first two seasons," he said. "It was a bit of a learning curve for me, the slow-burn, and then it became really exciting to play because it becomes a bit more challenging.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Macht has been married to wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jacinda Barrett</a> since 2004, and the pair welcomed their first child together in 2007. Their second child <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>was born</a> in 2014.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sarah-rafferty-as-donna-paulsen></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sarah Rafferty as Donna Paulsen</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=28><p>Shane Mahood/USA Network/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty ; Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sarah Rafferty played Donna Paulsen on Suits, a character that the actress has described to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Collider</a> as the “emotional glue” of the series. Rafferty was largely pleased with her role on the show, which also had her reunite with her real-life best friend of over two decades, Macht.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut, and has three sisters. She enjoyed a successful career on TV before joining Suits and had roles on CSI: Miami, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Charmed</a> and more. Rafferty has also continued to act since the end of Suits, having earned notable roles on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Grey’s Anatomy</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Chicago Med</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2018, Rafferty shared what the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>experience of attending</a> Markle and Prince Harry's wedding was like. As she put it, there were a few key moments that stood out. Rafferty said, “Seeing [Meghan] walk in on her own, in that moment before she met up with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Prince Charles</a> to walk the rest of the way, that was amazing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She attended the wedding with her husband, Santtu Seppälä, whom she's been married to since 2001.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rick-hoffman-as-louis-litt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rick Hoffman as Louis Litt</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Ian Watson/USA Network ; Ian West - WPA Pool/Getty&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rick Hoffman’s Louis Litt was hugely popular with fans of Suits, so much so that fans would stop him on the street to ask for hugs, as he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Collider</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for what it was like to play Louis, Hoffman said, “I am having the time of my life playing this character.&nbsp; At times, it’s unbelievably challenging and scary, when it comes to certain vulnerable areas that I don’t necessarily want to go.&nbsp; Who wants to open that up in front of a camera?&nbsp;But, it’s all rewarding.&nbsp; It’s just so much fun.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born and raised in N.Y.C., Hoffman graduated from The Wheatley School before he headed out west, attending college in Arizona and eventually making his way to L.A. He actually planned on a career in medicine before he began acting. His first role was in 1997’s Conspiracy Theory, and he acted on TV and in movies both before and after the end of Suits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, Hoffman was on hand to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrate the wedding</a> of Markle and Prince Harry in London, calling the event the “greatest weekend ever."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gina-torres-as-jessica-pearson></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gina Torres as Jessica Pearson</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Shane Mahood/USA Network/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty ; JC Olivera/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gina Torres was already a major name when she came on board Suits as Jessica Pearson, having enjoyed roles on shows like Firefly, Xena: Warrior Princess and Angel, as well as in the movies The Matrix: Reloaded and The Matrix: Revolutions. However, Suits managed to bring an even larger amount of awareness to Torres and her work.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Torres told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamour</a> that Suits came at exactly the right time in her life. As she put it, by the time she got the role, her mentality was, “I’m healthy, I’m happy, and I get to do something that I love doing. How many people get to say that? And I get to make a living at it. My focus was to achieve excellence in an arena that I had great respect and awe for and to find my place in it. That’s what I wanted to do.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress was born in N.Y.C. and grew up in the Bronx. In 2019, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>starred in her own</a> Suits spin-off titled Pearson, which lasted for 10 episodes. The series might not have made it in the long run, but Torres told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Collider</a> that bringing the idea for her character’s growth to fruition and working as both a producer and an actor on the series was rewarding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s very cool.

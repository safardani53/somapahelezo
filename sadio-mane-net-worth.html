He grew up in the small village of <strong>Bambali</strong>.</p><p>“Since i was two or three years old, i remember always being with the ball”</p><p>Similarly, Sadio came from a financially weak family. Furthermore, Mane couldn’t attend proper schooling and educational services as his parents couldn’t afford to pay the school fees.</p><p>Despite not attending any school, Mane developed a quick connection with soccer. Mane played soccer daily and night in the streets with his friends.</p><p>Moreover, Mane dreamt about playing in the premier league from a very young age.</p><p>Moving ahead, Mane also would visit soccer stadiums to see the national team play.

So, Mane only told his uncle about the move.</p><p>Likewise, Mane told his mother that he was in France only after reaching there.</p><p>Furthermore, his mother was in shock and disbelief upon hearing that her son had secretly traveled to France.

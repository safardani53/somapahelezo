"You see everything. You feel the weight of what's happening."</p><p>The American Top 40 host added: "You look over and you see it on a mom or dad's face," but had to take a moment to collect himself as he was nearing the verge of tears.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE on RYAN SEACREST">READ MORE on RYAN SEACREST</h2><p>"Sorry. I'm getting emotional talking about it," he told Will.</p><p>After taking a breath, Ryan continued: "When they're going through something tough with their kids."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/ryan-seacrest-admits-i-m-864579944.jpg><p>Will then questioned: "Why is this making you as emotional as it is?"</p><p>"We've gotten to know families. We've gotten to know the kids," Ryan replied.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>He continued: "I had a kid say to me, 'I'm very excited. It's going to be a great Christmas. I got approved to get new lungs.'</p><p>"It was as if he was getting a new bike. That kind of excitement."</p><p>Ryan stated that stories like that "really tap into your emotions."</p><p>The interview then cut to Ryan meeting with a patient, Payson Inkley, who revealed that he found so much "support and connection" from Seacrest Studios.</p><p>The <a href=#>GMA</a> correspondent then asked the former <a href=#>Live</a> host about his upcoming hosting gig on Wheel of Fortune to which Ryan replied that he was "so excited."</p><p>He could barely contain himself as he continued: "I grew up watching it. I'm such a fan.</p><p>"Pat Sajak is one of the greatest hosts in television."</p><p>Ryan continued to heap praise onto <a href=#>Pat</a> as he stated: "He's a legend. He's done such a brilliant job at navigating that show through all of these decades."</p><p>He then revealed: "I look forward to developing that kind of report with an audience in the evening," before confessing, "I'm excited, sure. I'm a little bit nervous too."</p><p>He and Will brought the conversation full circle when Ryan explained: "What's the point of doing all these other things and having some success in them if you can't give back?</p><p>"If you can't try and find that happiness for others."</p><p>Ryan concluded: "And that's what we try to do every day and what we hope to continue to do as the years go by."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>RYAN AND VANNA</h2><p>Last month, Ryan and <a href=#>Vanna White</a>, 66, were spotted together for the very first time in the name of Wheel of Fortune.</p><p>Vanna and&nbsp;Pat Sajak's&nbsp;successor - starting in fall 2024 - shot a commercial for the&nbsp;<a href=#>game show</a>&nbsp;in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p>Vanna took a hiatus from taping her final season with Pat, 77, to get acquainted with her next co-host on Saturday.</p><p>In a photo&nbsp;exclusively&nbsp;obtained by The U.S. Sun, the blonde beauty took to downtown Nashville with the&nbsp;radio&nbsp;host by her side.</p><p>Vanna sported full makeup, a red leather pantsuit, and her hair blown out in a country-style getup fitting for her surroundings.</p><p>Ryan, meanwhile, opted for a double-breasted blazer and jeans as they walked down the street.</p><p>The dynamic duo smiled as fans snapped photos of them from every direction.</p><p>The moment is meaningful as it marks Vanna and Ryan's first time filming together, making it our first look at Wheel's future.</p><p>It also marks Ryan's first time filming anything related to the beloved&nbsp;game show.</p><p>The fan who shared the snap above captioned it on&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook</a>: "Ryan Seacrest and Vanna White were walking down Broadway filming a commercial for Wheel of Fortune."</p><p>"They look so natural together!" one fan replied.</p><p>Other fans posted to Facebook that the pair were filming "promos," and the snap showed them headed to a venue to do so.</p><p>The promos would seemingly air on the show ahead of Ryan's takeover.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'HE CAN'T SPELL!'</h2><p>As longtime&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune&nbsp;host Pat&nbsp;prepares to step down in June, his co-host Vanna recently got a&nbsp;<a href=#>cheeky warning</a>&nbsp;about her new counterpart.</p><p>"Tell me everything," White said last month to&nbsp;<a href=#>Kelly Ripa</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Mark Consuelos</a> while appearing on their talk show. &nbsp;</p><p>Ryan famously co-hosted&nbsp;Live with Kelly and Ryan&nbsp;with Kelly for six years.</p><p>"He can’t spell," Consuelos said, as Ripa agreed, "Yeah, he cannot spell at all."</p><p>Vanna reacted in surprise and said: “Thanks for the warning!” And added they "haven't had rehearsals yet."</p><p>He then asked Vanna if she had “received texts” from him yet that may have proven as such, to which Vanna said she has.</p><p>Kelly then quipped: ”Maybe he’s dictating the texts and somebody’s typing it for him.</p><p>"Because, I will say - and I can say this freely, we have all experienced it here - when Ryan Seacrest texts you, you say to yourself, ‘This person is trying to tell me something.’ That’s the first thing.</p><p>"It’s that you realize that Ryan is&nbsp;trying&nbsp;to tell you something, but oftentimes, you just don’t know what that is!”</p><p>Vanna did say they've also communicated via phone, telling the married couple: "I called him to congratulate him on becoming the host.</p><p>"He was just so kind, and so he goes, ‘Look, no one’s ever going to replace Pat. I’m not trying to replace Pat.</p><p>"I’m just thrilled to be able to work with you, and I’ll do whatever it takes. Please teach me whatever I need to know.’"</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>PAT'S A WRAP!</h2><p>It’s nearly the end of an era for the iconic duo of Pat and Vanna.&nbsp;</p><p>In June,&nbsp;<a href=#>Pat announced</a>&nbsp;that he would be leaving Wheel of Fortune after 40 years.</p><p>Sajak previously posted to&nbsp;<a href=#>X</a>&nbsp;that while "it's been a wonderful ride," his 41st season would be his final one.</p><p>"Well, the time has come. I’ve decided that our 41st season, which begins in September, will be my last," he wrote.</p><p>He added: "It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ll have more to say in the coming months. Many thanks to you all. (If nothing else, it’ll keep the clickbait sites busy!)"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Sajak has hosted the famous game show since 1981.

Read on to learn 25 things about the 38-year-old actress, including the Disney song that always gets her crying and her greatest pet peeve.</p><p>1. I read tarot cards.</p><p>2. I studied abroad in Salvador, Brazil.</p><p>3. I sang [Bach’s] Cantata BWV 78 in German [with the choir] when I was [younger]. My best friend, voice teacher extraordinaire Peter Thoresen, and I still bust out the “Wir Eilen” after a little too much wine.</p><p>4. Speaking of wine, I’m certified (just barely) in wine and spirits.</p><p>5. I belonged to a Northern Praying Mantis kung fu school in my 20s.</p><p>6. I love learning and practicing languages.</p><p>7. I played first-chair clarinet in high school.</p><p>8. My first concert was <strong>Kathleen Battle</strong>.</p><p>9. My second concert was <strong><a href=#>Lionel Richie</a></strong>, who had <strong><a href=#>Tina Turner</a></strong> opening for him. I fell asleep for Richie. Did I mention I was 4?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Anna-Chlumsky-25-Things-You-DOnt-Know-About-Me-2.jpg><p>10. When I first moved to New York, I went to the Museum of Modern Art and happened upon Christina’s World by Andrew Wyeth and burst into tears.</p><p>11. I worked at Brookfield Zoo [in Chicago] for a summer. I wanted to be a zoologist.</p><p>12. I binge Joseph Campbell lectures on Spotify.</p><p>13. My cuticles are usually a wreck (nervous habit). Thank God for manicures.</p><p>14. I know all the colors of Joseph’s coat by heart — as per <strong>Tim Rice</strong> and <strong>Andrew Lloyd Webber</strong>.</p><p>15. I get very excited when my kids [Penelope, 5, and Clara, 2, with Shaun So] choose an M. Sasek book to read for story time.</p><p>16. At a writer-cast dinner, [Veep writer] <strong>Roger Drew</strong> told me to follow my instincts as a parent. Little did he know I was about to check into the hospital that evening and give birth to Penny. Best and most timely advice.</p><p>17. In college, I’d get creative with my answering machine greetings. You’d hear something like the theme from Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. Then “beeeeeep.”</p><p>18. When I was little, I’d help make apple tarts for my dad’s restaurant.</p><p>19. Without fail, I’ll start bawling whenever Moana sings.</p><p>20. I hate it when people spit in public. It really roughs me up. Watching baseball can be a challenge.</p><p>21. I keep a gratitude and joy journal. I highly recommend this practice for everyone.</p><p>22. My first car was a purple Dodge Neon. I put a pink “Road Sister” bumper sticker on it that my friend Tasha and I bought on a road trip to Columbus, Ohio.</p><p>23. My confirmation name is Ludmilla (after King Wenceslas’ grandmother).</p><p>24. She-Ra is a lifelong obsession, and I absolutely approve of the redux.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I make my own aromatherapy oils, balms, body butters and soaps. I haven’t figured out hand sanitizer yet.</p><p>Veep airs on HBO, Sundays at 10:30 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapp6WeqS0y66krKOpYn92edOhoKefo2LGsMGMnaanrF2gu7DDjJqZqK2kYrqmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

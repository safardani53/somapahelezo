Rotating arms inside the dishwasher squirt out these powerful jets of water, similar to a water sprinkler.</p><p>The dirty water is then drained away and the dishes are given a rinse to remove any residual detergent before that water is drained.</p><p>For drying, some dishwasher heat up the air to dry dishes, while others automatically pop open the door.</p><h2><strong>How much are dishwashers?</strong></h2><p>Depending on the features you want out of your dishwasher, and like most household appliances, the variance in price for dishwashers is huge.</p><p>Prices start at just under £200 for a basic model with minimal features and rise to well over £1,000 for the newest, most high tech models.</p><h2>How much water does a dishwasher use?</h2><p>On average, most modern dishwashers use between 11 and 13 litres of water every cycle.</p><h2><strong>How long does a dishwasher take?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>This very much depends on the cycle you choose and the cleaning power you need.</p><p>Most standard programmes last anywhere between an hour and a half and four hours, but the majority of dishwashers these days also offer a fast wash cycle, the quickest of which takes around 30 minutes if you need your cookware in a hurry.</p><h2><strong>Which is the best dishwasher?</strong></h2><p>We know that buying a dishwasher can be a tricky business. And with so many brands out there, it's easy to get lost.</p><p>We recommend looking at the most popular and trusted brands on the market such as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AEG</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> to find your perfect item.</p><h2><strong>How long do dishwashers last?</strong></h2><p>It's generally agreed that a dishwasher on average lasts around 10 years, but getting to eight years is a decent effort.</p><p>Some very robust machines have reportedly lived for 15 years and above.</p><h2><strong>Where to buy dishwashers</strong></h2><p>Many big high street names have a decent selection of dishwashers, including <a href=#>Currys</a>, <a href=#>Argos</a> and <a href=#>John Lewis</a>.</p><p>It's also worth checking any local appliance shops near you to see if they have any deals.</p><p>When it comes to online, the most popular retailers include: <a href=#>AO.com</a>, <a href=#>Marks Electrical</a> and <a href=#>Appliances Direct</a>.</p><h2><strong>What does dishwasher salt do?</strong></h2><p>Salt improves your dishwasher's cleaning power by softening the water used to clean your dishes.</p><p>Hard water can make it difficult for detergent to dissolve and, as it contains more lime, it also causes a white residue. Dishwasher salt softens the water to aid cleaning.</p><h2><strong>What size are slimline dishwashers?</strong></h2><p>A <a href=#>slimline dishwasher</a> is a smaller-capacity dishwasher perfect for smaller homes and is generally 45cm wide.</p><p>Most standard sized dishwashers are 60cm.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM SUN SELECTS HOME</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our roundup of the best dishwashers?

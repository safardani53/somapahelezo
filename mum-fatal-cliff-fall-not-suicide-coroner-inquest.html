I’ll be there in 20 minutes.”</p><p>Danyell then responded, saying she was in Dover, but added: “You’ll be too late.”</p><p>Danyell called 999 three time and 112 twice between 9.30pm and 9.40pm but none of these calls connected and there is no evidence of them being found in 999 call logs or phone bill data.</p><p>Around the same time, she also sent a number of messages to Mr Morris telling him where she was and that she planned to jump from the cliffs, the inquest heard.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>He told <a href=#>police</a> that due to the poor signal he never received the message Danyell sent him, which included her exact location, and he spent the rest of the night in Broadstairs bars.</p><p>At the hearing’s conclusion on Thursday, coroner Katrina Hepburn said two of the four messages Danyell sent did appear to have been delivered.</p><p>Mr Morris had been asked to give evidence at the hearing but Ms Hepburn said he had refused requests to attend or submit a written statement.</p><h2>MUM'S SEARCH</h2><p>Ms Eaton spent a large part of the night Danyell died desperately looking for her daughter but had to return home without locating her.</p><p>She waited until morning to report her missing because Danyell had been <a href=#>drink-driving</a> and had begged her not to call the cops.</p><p>Danyell’s body was found by a <a href=#>National Trust</a> worker on the shore at 10.15am the next morning.</p><p>Her cause of death was given as multiple injuries.</p><h2>NOT SUICIDE</h2><p>The coroner said there were a number of factors preventing her from ruling Danyell’s death as a suicide.</p><p>She indicated Danyell’s fear of being in trouble with the police as an example of “future thinking”.</p><p>Ms Hepburn also added there had been four previous incidents of Danyell taking an overdose and then informing friends or family, who insisted they were not suicide attempts but cries for help.</p><p>In conclusion, Ms Hepburn said: “There is evidence to suggest intention, but I bear in mind that there had been previous cries for help, and the fact that she disclosed what she was thinking of doing to a number of people.</p><p>“There were also a number of calls to emergency services that were unable to connect – which could have been to seek help.</p><p>“This advises me that she was not suicidal at this point. I believe her actions were a cry for help.”</p><p>Addressing Danyell’s family, she added: “ I hope this process has answered some of the questions you have, in so far as I have been able to do so in this inquest.</p><p>“My role is a narrow one, but I have attempted to answer the issues raised. I appreciate we are approaching the anniversary of her death, and I thank you for your patience.</p><p>“Dealing with any bereavement is difficult. The loss of Danyell, a beloved daughter, mother and friend in these circumstances has undoubtedly been a tragedy and I take the opportunity, once again, to offer you my condolences.”</p><h2>'BIG-HEARTED'</h2><p>Following the inquest’s first hearing in March, Ms Eaton paid tribute to her “big-hearted” daughter, who worked as a teaching assistant and had built her own business as an aesthetician.</p><p>She told <a href=# aria-label="KentOnline (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KentOnline</a>: "Danyell would go above and beyond for people - she always had a lot of time for everyone.</p><p>"She was generous, with her heart and her money. She never liked to think of anyone else being unhappy. If any of her friends were down she’d always want to get them out and have a good time.</p><p>"She was big-hearted, a lovely daughter and I was immensely proud of her getting her degree. She was a mum at a young age and she had battled all of these obstacles to get where she wanted to get to.”</p><p>Danyell had first moved to Kent in 2015 and set up home in <a href=#>Folkstone</a> before moving to Ramsgate a year before her death, where she lived with a friend.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She had struggled with <a href=#>mental health</a> issues since she was 14 and had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder in recent years, the inquest heard</p><p>Although she had been prescribed medication, the post-mortem toxicology report revealed Danyell had not been taking this for at least a week before she died.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/32-drawing-room-dining-room-29815646.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">You're Not Alone</h3></p><p>EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide.</p><p>It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.</p><p>It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes.</p><p>And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women.</p><p>Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.</p><p>That is why&nbsp;<a href=#>The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign.</a></p><p>The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.</p><p>Let's all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others...&nbsp;<a href=#>You're Not Alone.</a></p><p>If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:</p><ul><li>CALM,&nbsp;<a href=#>www.thecalmzone.net</a>, 0800 585 858</li><li>Heads Together,&nbsp;<a href=#>www.headstogether.org.uk</a></li><li>Mind,&nbsp;<a href=#>www.mind.org.uk</a>, 0300 123 3393</li><li>Papyrus,<a href=#>&nbsp;www.papyrus-uk.org</a>, 0800 068 41 41</li><li>Samaritans,&nbsp;<a href=#>www.samaritans.org</a>, 116 123</li><li>Movember,&nbsp;<a href=#>www.uk.movember.com</a></li><li>Anxiety UK&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.anxietyuk.org.uk</a>, 03444 775 774 Monday-Friday 9.30am-10pm, Saturday/Sunday 10am-8pm</li></ul><figure class=article__media></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ39zhZVqaHJnnaq6brLArZilZZOhtqeyjJ%2BYpaRdo7y1edKuoJyhlJp6pLvRqKWeql2eu7LBxKyraA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

I lost it purely through calorie deficit alone and meal prepping to keep me on track and focused.</p><p>“Meal prepping helps keep you focused and on track. It aids with portion control and building healthier habits.</p><p>“I found having my meals all calorie counted and pre-prepared helped keep me focused and gain some control over my eating habits, as I knew exactly what was in them, and it helped me learn to cook better.</p><p>“I have slashed my weekly or monthly food shopping <span id=feeb51c5-0724-46eb-b7da-4f0cac650985 class=suggested-link>bills</span> in half if not more by meal prepping, and I spend a lot less on takeaways by making my own healthier fakeaway versions.”</p><p>Weighing 10 stone 2lbs, she claims she would need 2,000 calories to maintain that diet, so if she creates a meal plan of 1,777 calories then she can expect to lose one pound in per week.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Meal plan for maintaining her weight</h3></p><p>Breakfast : Chocolate baked oat muffins (300 calories)</p><p>Lunch : Pizza pasta salad (550 calories)</p><p>Dinner : Hoisin glazed beef and noodles (600 calories)</p><p>Snacks : Greek yogurt and berries (310 calories)</p><p>Protein Pudding (160 calories)</p><p>Low Calorie Crisps (78 calories).</p><p>Total: 1,998 calories</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Diverse meals</h2><p>Charlotte ensures she has balance of everything in her meal-prepped dishes.</p><p>She will pick different carb sources for example potato for one meal, rice for another meal, then maybe pasta for the third.</p><p>She will then do the same for protein, for example, chicken for one meal, salmon for another, then maybe beef, or even a vegetable option like chickpeas.</p><p>Then she adds good fats and vegetables, again picking variety so the meals are different, this keeps it enjoyable and not repetitive eating the same thing everyday.</p><p>Charlotte added: “Don’t cut things out or restrict yourself.</p><p>“Before meal prepping my diet was pretty terrible, breakfast: nothing, lunch: nothing, dinner was takeaway, or microwave meal, I would snacks on crisps, chocolate, sugary drinks and so no exercise at all.</p><p>“Now thanks to meal prepping it is much better.&nbsp;</p><p>“For breakfast my favourite is chocolate baked oat muffins, lunch usually a pizza pasta salad for dinner I love hoisin glazed beef and noodles.</p><p>“I still snack, just now I will pick up low calorie crisps, opt for greek yogurt and berries, protein pudding or fruit as a sweet fix.</p><p>“I also go to the gym three days-a-week now.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her favourite cheap dish</h2><p>Charlotte said one of her favourite meal preps is curry as they are “so flavoursome” even days after preparing.</p><p>She added: “You can straight away save yourself a good £4 or so by substituting your usual beef or chicken at £5, for tinned chickpeas or butter beans at only 59p per tin for example, in just one meal.</p><p>I lost all my weight never stepping foot inside a gym.

Meanwhile, Heather’s&nbsp;RHOC&nbsp;co-star,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Pedranti</strong></a>, also chimed in to send Terry some love. “Happy Birthday Terry!!!” the blonde beauty penned. One of the sweetest notes was from Terry’s daughter, Max, herself who wrote, “i love you dad !!!! happy birthday.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The birthday celebrations come just six weeks after Heather and Terry confirmed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ&nbsp;</a>that he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>suffered a mini stroke</a> the week prior. When he recalled the health scare to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a> that same day, Terry made sure to credit his wife for being his life saver. “Listen to your partner. If they are concerned about something don’t argue, don’t ignore and get it checked out right away,” he told the mag after Heather insisted that he see a doctor despite his pushback. “What they see may be very different than what you perceive. Be grateful for those who love you. I love my wife, thank god for Heather and her persistence and insistence. She truly saved my life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Terry and his wife revealed that doctors discovered that he had a hole in his heart also known as a&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>patent foramen ovale (PFO)</a>. Additionally, his medical team informed him that “a blood clot passed through the PFO, traveled to his brain and caused the TIA.” On Aug. 9, Heather <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a selfie</a> with her husband and gushed over him in the caption. “I love this man with my whole heart. I’m beyond grateful that Terry’s ok, this could have gone very differently. If you see someone having stroke like symptoms- get them to the Hospital,” she captioned the post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5BtZqGdkam1pr6Mnaybqp%2BseqSxy56Zq5mkmsButMSrZKGto5eur7CMm6CrrJiZrrp5wJ%2Brnqpdnba0edKtqaijlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

But a dark lord named Sauron forges “the one ring” and gives it part of his power. His purpose: To overpower the other rings and conquer Middle Earth!</p><p>Men and elves come together to battle Sauron’s army in a place called Mordor. Sauron’s finger with the ring on it is severed, and his physical form is destroyed. The ring is soon lost.</p><p>We cut to Bilbo celebrating his 111th birthday and meeting up with Gandalf the Grey, where the last <i>Hobbit </i>movie ended. Bilbo decides to leave his home for one last adventure and gives the ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins (<a href=#><b>Elijah Wood</b></a>).</p><p>Gandalf learns Gollum was captured by Sauron’s orcs and kept uttering “Shire” and “Baggins.” As a result, the wizard urges Frodo to leave the Shire. Frodo does this, taking his friend Samwise Gamgee (<a href=#><b>Sean Astin</b></a>) with him.</p><p>Gandalf then meets with the wizard Saruman (<a href=#><b>Christopher Lee</b></a>), who it’s revealed has joined forces with Sauron. And the hunt is now on for Frodo.</p><p>Saruman takes Gandalf prisoner. Frodo and his friend connect with other hobbits and are helped by a ranger named Strider (<a href=#><b>Viggo Mortensen</b></a>). Arwen (<a href=#><b>Liv Tyler</b></a>), who is Strider's romantic partner, rescues Frodo when he’s attacked by Sauron’s forces.</p><p>She then takes him to a place called Rivendell, where he’s reunited with an escaped Gandalf. Arwen’s father, Lord Elrond (<b>Hugo Weaving</b>), holds a council meeting, where they determine the ring must be destroyed by being thrown into the volcanic Mount Doom.</p><p>Frodo agrees to take the ring, going with Gandalf, Sam, and other hobbits, warriors, and Strider. But it turns out Strider is really a royal heir named Aragorn. The journey toward Mount Doom kicks off. During an attack, Gandalf is dragged down a pit by an enemy. This <i>appears</i> to be the death of him.</p><p>In the end, Bilbo and Sam go off alone on their quest, fearing the corrupting power of the ring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BhvLOwjKidZqyYmnqztc2gqmaZnpl6qbvBm6CtZZikxG7AzmaumqyTnXq1tMRmpKiumZrAbrXNZqarnJWnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

They’d talked about it beforehand and the young couple definitely looked prepared for the big moment. “I asked her to stay as still as she could and just go with it,” the Duggar brother said. Everyone in their 1,000-member audience clapped and cheered, and then Josiah went back in for seconds. Lauren smiled, leaned back and told him no, and then they finished the wedding off.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The two rushed outside to their getaway car after the reception, but Josiah, the master prankster, got a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>taste of his own medicine</a>. His brothers had covered a junkyard vehicle with wrapping paper, then plastered the Mustang he’d&nbsp;really&nbsp;be driving with colorful Post-Its. The back of the car was filled with stinky cheese and sardines — and someone wearing a Ghillie suit. Yes, really!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>But nothing could get Josiah and Lauren down on their special day. They couldn’t have looked more thrilled at their wedding — and the fun is only going to continue now that they’ve tied the knot. Before their wedding day, the two wrote down 52 reasons why they loved each other so they could read out a new reason every single week. How cute is that?</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>With a tea party bridal shower, a sweet first look in a cap sleeve dress and issues with a gluten-free cake, Josiah and Lauren’s wedding had enough going on for an entire episode’s worth of drama. But somehow, TLC’s two-hour&nbsp;Counting On&nbsp;special also managed to cram in&nbsp;<strong>Jinger&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Jeremy Vuolo</strong>‘s first birthing class — as well as <strong>John David Duggar</strong>‘s surprise courtship reveal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH5xe49qZqOno56uqXnDrp6gmaJiuaLB0Z6lZqunlru0u81mrp6clJ67qHnFoqmsrF2gtrS%2FjJymrqaknruoec6nZKudk5a9cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

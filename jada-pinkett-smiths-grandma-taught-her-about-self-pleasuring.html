The actress spoke candidly about her early experiences with masturbation in the Monday, June 11, episode of her Facebook Watch show, Red Table Talk.</p><p>“My grandmother taught me about self-pleasuring because she wanted me to know that that pleasure was from me,” Pinkett Smith, 46, recalled to her mother, <strong>Adrienne Banfield-Jones</strong>, and daughter, <strong><a href=#>Willow Smith</a></strong>. “She didn’t want me to fall into the hands of a man — and if he gave me pleasure, to think that that was him. And she taught me at 9!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jada-pinkett-smith.jpg><p>The Girls Trip star admitted that she still “struggled in my own sexuality” even though she had the information from her grandma. But eventually, she became comfortable.</p><p>“I’ve had a lot of experience with sex toys … I think by your age, I gave myself multiples first. Multiple orgasms,” she told Willow’s friend Telana Lynum, 21. “I was really into it at one point, just because I was in an exploration state and I was abstaining from men.”</p><p>Pinkett Smith continued, “I actually think I went through kind of an addiction, too, with it. And then one day, I was just like, ‘Enough. You’re having five orgasms a day.’ You get addicted ‘cause you can create so much pleasure. You just constantly want it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/willow-smith.jpg><p>The Matrix Reloaded actress (who has been married to <strong><a href=#>Will Smith</a></strong> since 1997) went on to share some advice with young viewers. “Just wait till you find that person that you care about,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During the conversation, Willow, 17, said she was first introduced to sex when she walked in on her parents in the bedroom, a revelation that shocked Pinkett Smith.</p><p>“I think it was in Aspen. I was going downstairs to get some juice and I saw for a little moment and I ran away,” the “Whip My Hair” singer recounted. “I was like, ‘Oh, my God. This is so crazy. What did I just see?’ But it wasn’t like I was seeing everything. The room was dark. … [I felt like] I overstepped a boundary.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZSWerG1zaScraxdqLqqwMesZKCqkaOxrq2MrZiun5ipeqmx0WaYm6elqXq0scufZKmklZbAtr7Ip55o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

He’s an addict,” Standifer said.</p><p>“There are four other charges pending. Hopefully, he’ll get more.”</p><p>She concluded by revealing that Ryan’s abuse is making it nearly impossible for her to raise her children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I have a job – they don’t like this is going on,” Mackenzie concluded.</p><p>During the hearing, an officer took the stand to share a shocking account or Ryan’s most recent arrest.</p><p>“The truck rolled into a curb on the driver’s side. The curb stopped the vehicle. It was just Mr. Edwards. He was unconscious, unresponsive,” said the officer.</p><p>“Fire was there. They were using a lockout kit to gain entry to the vehicle. He did not regain consciousness until he was put in medical and administered Narcan,” he continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“There were two small baggies on Mr. Edwards. A white-blue powder and a crystal substance.”</p><p>:”It appears Mr. Edwards would’ve violated probation by leaving treatment early. Mr. Edwards picked up two new criminal charges,” said an attorney for the state.</p><p>“For the court, given part of the probation violation is these new charges, he’s conceding the violation.”</p><p>“He was supposed to be in Austin, Texas. He was admitted March 16 and was discharged April 3,” Judge Gary Starnes noted, referring to Ryan’s brief stint in rehab.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“This court is used to seeing probation violations, this defendant received a lenient break from this court and my office in March,” the DA added.</p><p>“He was given the opportunity for the second or third time to pursue rehabilitation.”</p><p>Many who have been observing the case have wondered why Ryan has been shown so much leniency, and now, a surprising theory has emerged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Judge Starnes raised eyebrows in court when he called Ryan “a very fine young man” and referenced the fact that “we’ve all watched [Ryan] grow up” and that “we all know Mr. Edwards and his family.”</p><p>It was widely assumed that the judge was referring to watching Ryan grow up on MTV, but as The Ashley’s Reality Roundup <a href=#>reports</a>, the judge has known Edwards for most of his life, and he even attended the defendants’ 2017 wedding.</p><p>It seems that Ryan has been friends with Judge Starnes’ daughter Christina since childhood, and the two families still live just a few houses down from one another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I’m trying to save your life,” Starnes told Ryan yesterday.</p><p>“At some point, I may send you to rehab. You won’t do it now. It’s because the drug addiction is so strong. You can’t do it. You have to grow up and want to save yourself. I’m going to do what I can to save you.”</p><p>It appears Mackenzie was in a similarly forgiving mood on Thursday, writing on Instagram:</p><p>“Stop talking down on people who lost their way and start praying they find their way,”</p><p>Hopefully, Ryan will begin showing some appreciation for all of this compassion he’s received.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WBcLnAnKKepqqesm6%2F05qlnaGWmr9usMSmmKeco2K5sLrGnqlmq5Wjwaa6wp5kn6eiYr%2B6rc1mnJ2vkaextHnArGStnZWjeq67zGaqrZmiqHqku82nnJysmaS7tHnTqGSjrZScsm6t0Z5knrCgpMCmsI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

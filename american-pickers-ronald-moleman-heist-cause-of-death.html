Purple, lime green, orange, pink and yellow; the colors were far from mellow, he said ‘the brighter, the better!’ But, when it came to songs you better ‘Paint it Black!’ Anybody that knew Ron, they know what we're talkin' about!</p><p>“Ron loved his oldies music and could name a tune in one note. A faithful caller to the oldies radio stations song request shows they all knew Ronald well. We will miss hearing, ‘this one is for Ronald.’</p><p>“Ron had a unique personality, a genius in his own way, a child at heart. He loved building, he could look at a house and precisely recreate it with Legos or City Blocks; building was his passion. He was a prankster, when he pulled a good one, he had a twinkle in his eye and had that cute sheepish grin going on.&nbsp;</p><p>“He treasured his many friends and they thought the world of him. He helped them out and they helped him. We thank all of those friends who made Ronald's life a memorable one; there was never a dull moment with Ronald, there was always an adventure to be had!”</p><p>The obituary ended: “Hey Heaven, it's Ronald's calling! As Ron would say, ‘You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet!’”</p><p>The family asked loved ones to wear bright colors for the visitation and to prepare adventure stories that would “make him smile.”</p><h2>ANOTHER LOSS</h2><p>This isn't the first American Pickers guest star that has passed recently.</p><p>Back in 2022, Mike, 58, shared a heart-wrenching post about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">death of a friend</a> who appeared on the show.</p><p>The reality star took to his Instagram page to share some kind words about a man named Bob Peterson.</p><p>Alongside a clip from Bob's appearance on the show, Mike wrote: "A few days ago we lost a man that we looked to as a mentor. Not just with mechanical things, but in how we should live our lives.&nbsp;</p><p>"Bob was an example to us as someone that loved life and seized each day with so much passion. Always there to help with such conviction and of course humor. He was from an era that we can only romanticize about now."</p><p>He concluded: "My life and so many others lives were better with him in it… He will be greatly missed. I love you my friend."</p><h2>FRANK'S HEALTH BATTLE</h2><p>Bob's passing came just months after Frank found himself in the hospital dealing with serious medical issues of his own.</p><p>Frank, 59, was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hospitalized for a stroke</a> on July 14 after a friend found him on the floor of his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Iowa</a> home.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Frank’s friends <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filed an emergency appointment</a> of temporary guardian and conservator for the star on August 18, claiming his “decision­-making capacity is so impaired.”</p><p>He has been <a href=#>in and out of the hospital</a> since with seizures and pneumonia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/ronald-c-moleman-heist-grabs-801963351-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/2021-star-american-pickers-frank-666254556-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZm6CeoCUaJimnaKesKK6jKmgnKOVp8Buvs6nmKWcXaK8rbHMmqVmoJWewLV5wpqsrJ1dpLNusMSaq6Fn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

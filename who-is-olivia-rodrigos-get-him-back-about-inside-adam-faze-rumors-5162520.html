I’m so bad at this. I don’t want to,’ whatever, being really negative. Then, we took a break, and we came back and we wrote ‘Get Him Back,’ and it’s one of my favorite songs.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>She then noted that the lyrics were “super fun to write.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“I really like the chorus. It feels sticky to me, and it feels like something that I would want a crowd to sing,” Olivia added.

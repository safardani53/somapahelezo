But Desiree chose “Dog Love” for specific reasons, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ </a>reports. “One, it’s something X himself used to say. Second, our sources say Desiree considers a dog’s love to be unconditional, much like X’s,” the site noted. It added that she got the tattoo done on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>day of his death</a>, shortly after X passed away at the age of 50 following complications of a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>massive heart attack</a> he suffered one week prior.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kristal shared a photo of her work on Desiree’s arm to Instagram and paid tribute to the late <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yonkers, NY native</a>. “I feel honored to be able to do this memorial but also saddened.

People took her photos and made a fake <a href=# rel=follow>OnlyFans</a> account under her name. She confirmed to the news outlet that she had never created such an account and was baffled when she found out about it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She iterated that she wanted to “go into the shadows and return to teaching.”</p><p>However, some people supported her, such as the director of the Novosibirsk City Open College, Sergei Chernyshev.</p><p>He said that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the teacher had done no wrong</a> and that firing her would be unfair. The director even offered to hire Kashirina.</p><p>So far, it is unconfirmed if Kashirina has been fired or not.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaK6ZoMGwvsiaZKSZo522s7XNmmSsrKKevbWxwKycZq6ZmbKwesetpKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

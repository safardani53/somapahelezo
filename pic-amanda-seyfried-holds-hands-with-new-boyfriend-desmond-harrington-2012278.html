Seyfried wore tiny denim shorts, a long white shirt, black cardigan, combat boots and dark sunglasses for the outing. Harrington, who carried an umbrella in case of bad weather, showed off the tattoo on his arm in a large gray shirt.</p><p>A source tells <a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a> that Harrington’s Dexter costar <strong>Jennifer Carpenter</strong> had the idea to set the couple up.

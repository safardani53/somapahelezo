I had been single for quite some time and my friends were telling me to go on it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more Love Island stories">Read more Love Island stories</h2><p>“I applied and I got on which I was surprised about, I didn’t think I would actually get on it. But I stayed true to myself and stayed confident.</p><p>“I went through the audition process and was surprised and shocked when I was told I got it.”</p><p>But Lynda explained that she felt blindsided by producers, as she had asked not to be a Casa Amor girl, so was shocked when she arrived in South Africa and was told she wouldn’t be a Bombshell.</p><p>She said: “I didn’t know I was going to be in Casa Amor. I auditioned to be a Bombshell. They already had the OGs lined up already so by the time they interviewed me was when they were looking for Bombshells.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Love Island</h2></p><p>“I remember saying to the producers that I really didn’t want to go in as a Casa girl, but they didn’t even answer, they just said ‘yeah, yeah, yeah’ and then at the last minute they told me I was going into Casa. They didn’t tell me I would be in Casa Amor, not until the last minute.</p><p>“I’d obviously flown out all the way to South Africa, I didn’t want to just go back home, it would’ve been a waste of my time after a week of waiting, so I had to just accept the offer.&nbsp;</p><p>I got barely any air time. I was surprised because I was talking to the guys and getting to know everyone. It wasn’t really fair.</p><p>“To be honest, I would’ve preferred to be a Bombshell. You have more time to get to know people. The Casa Amor process was very short, it was literally a few days. I found it hard to make a connection in those few days.”</p><p>While Lynda has never watched the show back, she explained that she was told by countless people that she had barely any air time.</p><p>She revealed: “I got barely any air time. I was surprised because I was talking to the guys and getting to know everyone. I felt like they didn’t show anything of me talking to anyone. It wasn’t really fair.</p><p>“I was in Casa Amor for four days. It was a good experience, but not knowing how you’d be portrayed and how it would be edited was scary.</p><p>“I didn’t know I wouldn’t have air time. I came out and people said ‘we didn’t even see you’ and then people started coming for my braids.</p><p>“People said ‘her braids look old’, ‘why do her braids look like that?’.</p><p>"But the funny thing was, when I was told I was on the show, they said they would provide someone to do my braids while I was there.</p><p>"So I took hair extensions with me, thinking that someone could do it while I was in the holding period. But then when I asked they said that they couldn’t do it so I had to go in. It was very unfair.&nbsp;</p><p>“The hair was already grown out and it was last minute when I flew over.”</p><p>Looking back at her lack of air time, Lynda opened up about how it made her feel.</p><p>She admitted: “I felt mugged off. I felt like a joke.&nbsp;</p><p>“The other Casa people got shown more than me but I was literally not even shown talking to anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was shown in the intro and then just me sleeping and doing my make-up and that’s just not right.&nbsp;</p><p>“I didn’t watch it back, I couldn’t. Everyone told me I wasn’t shown so I felt like if I watched it I’d feel even worse. People were even making memes on Twitter and joking that I was a missing person.</p><p>“When I got out, it was really hard on me, I felt quite low. I had literally lost my job as well, so it was really hard.”</p><p>I felt mugged off. I felt like a joke.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only did she not get much air time, but she also didn’t think the Casa Amor experience was fair, as it wasn’t long enough.</p><p>She continued: “Personally, I feel like the experience could've been longer, at least a couple more days.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think it was unfair going into Casa Amor and only having a couple of days to get to know someone.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s realistic in the real world. I felt like that was rushed.&nbsp;</p><p>“People were being competitive with each other. I felt I had to put myself out there and do more than I normally would do in the outside world. It made me feel uncomfortable.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, Lynda revealed that she did in fact have a slight connection during her time in Casa Amor, with Shaq.&nbsp;</p><p>She explained: “I think people thought I was shy and wasn’t talking to anyone, which wasn’t the case.</p><p>“I was getting to know the guys and they probably thought there weren't any strong connections because I didn't kiss anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>“But at the beginning there was a bit of flirting with me and Shaq.&nbsp;</p><p>“We had a flirt and he said he could see things going somewhere with me, and I felt they could’ve at least shown that, but they didn’t. Shaq knows that he said that so it’s funny that they didn’t air that.&nbsp;</p><p>“I had a bit of a connection with him, him reciprocating that he could see things going somewhere with me and him saying I was attractive, that was nice.”</p><p>Lynda explained that the lack of air time continued at the Love Island Reunion too.</p><p>She shared: “Even at the reunion, two producers came up to me and said ‘Lynda, you’re so confident, why weren’t you like that on the show?’</p><p>"But I was confident so I didn't know what they were talking about. They were trying to make it seem like it was my fault.</p><p>“I was even questioning not going to the reunion because of it but I thought they would let me talk for a change, but they didn’t.”&nbsp;</p><p>People were being competitive with each other. I felt I had to put myself out there and do more than I normally would do in the outside world. It made me feel uncomfortable.</p><p>Since coming out of the show, Lynda opened up on how things have been.</p><p>She noted: “I am grateful that I got a chance to go on the show, and even with me not being shown, people are so supportive of me.</p><p>“People say ‘you have such a personality, I wish you were shown more’ and people are getting to know the real me now that the show has ended.”</p><p>But although Lynda has had an influx of positive attention, she explained that people have been nasty too.</p><p>She claimed: “There’s trolls everywhere, people say everything.&nbsp;</p><p>“I never thought I’d get hate comments but I’ve had hate comments with people saying I look like a boy. They say I look like a man.”&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily for Lynda, things are looking up. While she hasn’t currently got a full-time job, she has been working hard on music and has recently released her first single.</p><p>She said: “Now I’m starting a new job as a Health Advisor in the next two weeks.</p><p>“I’ve always been a musician but only just started taking it seriously.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“I have been getting lots of music offers from music companies and I might end up in the US in future.”</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.

Production will take place in the U.K., Peru, and Columbia, according to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. The film probably won’t come out until 2024 or maybe even 2025. The first two Paddington movies were released in 2014 and 2017, respectively.</p><h2>Paddington 3 Cast & Crew</h2><h3>Cast</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>As we mentioned already, Ben Whishaw is returning to voice Paddington for the third time.

She’s been replaced by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emily Mortimer</strong></a>. Sally addressed her exit from the franchise in a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statement</a>, saying, “For me it has felt the right time to hand the reins over to another, and one can’t get much better than the truly wonderful Emily Mortimer, she is extraordinarily special. She will embody the essence of Mary Brown and yet make it utterly her own.&nbsp; However, I am, and will always be in love with Paddington’s world. I already greatly miss my on and off-screen family — the experience of making the first two films has truly been some of the best and most creative times I have had in the world of film. They both gave me so much joy. I will forever hold them so very close to my heart indeed.”</p><h3>Crew</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Paul King </strong>directed the first two Paddington films but he left the franchise to direct <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wonka</a>&nbsp;starring <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Timothee Chalamet</strong></a>. <strong>Dougal Wilson </strong>has stepped in to helm Paddington 3&nbsp;in his directorial debut. “After ten years of working on the Paddington movies, I feel absurdly protective of the little bear, and I’m delighted that Dougal will be there to hold his paw as he embarks on his third big screen adventure,” Paul King said in <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statement</a>. “Dougal’s work is never less than astounding: funny, beautiful, heartfelt, imaginative, and totally original. Aunt Lucy once asked us to ‘Please Look After This Bear.’ I know Dougal will do so admirably.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>StudioCanal and Heyday Films are producing the third film like they did the first two. The screenplay is by <strong>Mark Burton,&nbsp;Jon Foster</strong> and <strong>James Lamont</strong>, according to&nbsp;Deadline.

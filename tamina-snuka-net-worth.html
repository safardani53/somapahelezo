Fellow WWE superstar Nia Jax is also related to the creator of The People's Eyebrow, albeit a bit more closely. Her dad, Joseph Fanene, was directly related to Peter Maivia, The Rock's grandfather.</p><p>In the early days of The Rock's career, he was even billed as Rocky Maivia, a head nod to both his dad and connection to the Anoa'i family.

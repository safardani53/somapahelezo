The We’re The Millers star’s hair was its usual perfection, with her blown out blonde locks likely courtesy of her longtime hairdresser and BFF <strong>Chris McMillan.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Jen appeared to be heading to meetings or some other professional activity as her look was all business. She wore a pair of tan wide-legged trousers with chic leopard print heels. She topped it off with a smart, double-breasted cropped black blazer with tan cuffs. She held on to her smart phone and a pair of reading glasses as she left the coffee shop, where she and a pal spent about 40 minutes inside according to paparazzi.

Ever since Friends left the air 2004, the actress has focused on films with only a few guest spots on TV.

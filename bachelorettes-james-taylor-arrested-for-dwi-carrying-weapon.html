He had been held under two separate ones: a $2,000 fine for his DWI and a $4,000 bond for his possession of a firearm.&nbsp;The former reality TV star has yet to publicly address his recent arrest.</p><p class=p1>Taylor initially rose to fame as one of <a href=#><strong>JoJo Fletcher</strong></a>’s suitors during season 12 of the ABC dating show. The&nbsp;<i>Cash Pad&nbsp;</i>host, 31, sent him home during the show’s seventh week before eventually accepting a proposal from <a href=#><strong>Jordan Rodgers</strong></a>. The duo <a href=#>wed in May after a six-year engagement</a>.</p><p class=p1>Despite walking away without the final rose, the “Great Again” singer doesn’t regret his reality TV experience.</p><p class=p1>“Sure, we all wanted the girl. But I think I did it the right way.&nbsp;That’s been great for me now because <a href=#>people want to keep in touch, be friends</a> and help each other where we can,” Taylor previously told<a href=#>&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>IndyStar</a>&nbsp;</i>in August 2016. “<strong><a href=#>Wells [Adams]</a>&nbsp;</strong>wants to help push my album. He’s a radio guy. That’s really cool. The fact that I didn’t treat him like a radio guy or like a competitor is huge. I treated him like a friend, and now that’s&nbsp;just&nbsp;a perk. Always looking out for others over yourself is&nbsp;the main thing I learned.”</p><p class=p1>Taylor, however, has since been “exiled from Bachelor Nation,” according to the show’s executive producer <a href=#><strong>Mike Fleiss</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“Whoever that former cast member/idiot jerkoff is that went to Trump’s treasonous rally, got a message for ya … You are officially exiled from #BachelorNation!!!” Fleiss, 58,&nbsp;<a href=#>tweeted in January 2021</a>, shortly after Taylor confirmed he had attended the January 6 riot at the Capitol. “Shame on you.”</p><p class=p1>Taylor has even added an “exiled from Bachelor Nation” label to his<a href=#> Instagram</a> profile bio.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The former ABC personality had previously revealed last year that he attended the rally in favor of <a href=#><strong>President Donald Trump</strong></a>’s quest to remain in office despite <a href=#><strong>President Joe Biden</strong></a> winning the general election.</p><p class=p1>“Big thanks to #TheBachelor family for supporting me during this time … from top to bottom,” Taylor <a href=#>tweeted at the time</a>. “Conservative producers are the best!! Thank you @ABCNetwork @ABC & @BachelorABC for having my back while I legally supported our President.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270Z6rrZ2jYreiucSsZK2ZqaG8s3nAq6meq6SasW6yzqtkna%2BZYrCivtGyoKefXayyorzOp2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

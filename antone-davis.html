Family Explored</h3><p>Moving on to his family, Antone is happily married to his wife, Caire. They have yet to give detailed information about their relationship.</p><p>Antone and his wife Caire have four children: two sons and two daughters. Furthermore, Antone’s oldest son, Dakota, played college football for the Chattanooga Mocs as an offensive lineman. But sadly, his career came to an end from concussions.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/052005-davis1_original.jpg><p>On the other hand, his younger son, Braden, is a highly-recruited quarterback for Lake Minneola High School, located in Minneola, Florida. As of now, the family of six is living a blissful life.</p><h2>When did Antone Davis Debut in NBA Draft?</h2><p>Antone Davis started his NFL career in 1991 as the eighth overall pick of the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1991 NFL Draft. After 21 days, he officially signed a temporary contract and started training with the team.</p><p>The Eagles had traded two first-round draft picks in order to draft Davis.&nbsp;Besides that, Davis always felt pumped on himself after selecting such a fantastic team with fantastic offense and defense.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/539453_288774531198014_339464746_n.jpg><p>Recalling those memories, from Davis’ point of view, Reggie was always the muscular guy; though he might never win over him, he always felt he was learning every day more and more.</p><h3>Antone On His Teammates</h3><p>Reggie’s love and respect were so unique that though Reggie was always up against Antone and not suitable as him, seeing him blocking made Davis inspire a lot.</p><p>All over, Davis had spent 5 years of his life with the Eagles. Even so, Davis wished it could have been more and best for his team.</p><p>He really felt like he could have given his best in more games. During his time with the Eagles, coaches were changed more than twice, starting from Bill Walsh, Bill Muir, and finally Bill Callahan.</p><p>Every coach’s aim and perception of the game might be the same, but there were many changes in the system’s case.</p><p>Maybe because of the said reason, Antony felt like there was always a new beginning in games and a difference in the team’s strategy on every game. The inconsistency made him uncomfortable.</p><p>Compared with his old days with today’s teams, Davis says that each group can block their five linemen helping and reading each other’s minds.</p><p>They have the purpose of maintaining a back chip block a defensive end, whereas the tight end always stays at least a couple of times.</p><p>But in that period, Antone felt he got none of those from his teammate Rich Kotite. To such extent that it made him feel as he was on the island, where he had to fight all along by him alone.</p><p>Hence, when he looks up to the recent rising stars and the team, the thoughts become even more evident; that you really need someone to lift you.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Antone spent his following two seasons with Atlanta and got retired in 1998.</p><h3>Antone Davis on Resignation</h3><p>Antone Davis states he would resign after becoming the subject of “constant intimidation, bullying and mental abuse from University of Tennessee head football coach Butch Jones.”</p><p>Moreover, in resignation later, he added, working with such a partner had been the worst experience he ever had.</p><p>After working for six years on the same job concentrating on his student’s/athletes lives, Davis wrote another email that they had also been in abuse of the same circumstances.</p><p>Antone further claimed that he was not interested in leaving the job but had to. But it is and will always be his biggest regret that he had to go his students on the same treatment the way he had received.</p><p>In fact, Grant Ramey 247 sports said Antone was made to travel on his own accommodation for the game that year and stripped of multiple other jobs.</p><h3>NFL Highlights and Awards</h3><ul><li>First-team All-SEC(1989)</li><li>Jacobs Awards (1990)</li><li>First-team All-SEC (1990)</li><li>First-team All-America (1990)</li></ul><h2>Antone Davis | Career Stats</h2><table width=1248><tr><td><strong>YEAR</strong></td><td>TEAM</td><td>G</td><td>FUM</td><td>LOST</td><td>FF</td><td>OWN FR</td><td>OPP FR</td><td>TD</td></tr><tbody><tr><td width=135>1997</td><td width=147>Atlanta Falcons</td><td width=135>3</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>1</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td></tr><tr><td width=135>1996</td><td width=147>Atlanta Falcons</td><td width=135>16</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td></tr><tr><td width=135>1995</td><td width=147>Philadelphia Eagles</td><td width=135>15</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td></tr><tr><td width=135>1994</td><td width=147>Philadelphia Eagles</td><td width=135>16</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td></tr><tr><td width=135>1993</td><td width=147>Philadelphia Eagles</td><td width=135>16</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td></tr><tr><td width=135>1992</td><td width=147>Philadelphia Eagles</td><td width=135>15</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td></tr><tr><td width=135>1991</td><td width=147>Philadelphia Eagles</td><td width=135>16</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td><td width=135>0</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>97</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Antone Davis’s Net Worth</h2><p>Antone once used the NFL player, his average net worth is $400,000-$600,000 annually, but same as starts can make $50 million or more.</p><p>Moreover, Antone has also been involved in investments and coaching careers before.

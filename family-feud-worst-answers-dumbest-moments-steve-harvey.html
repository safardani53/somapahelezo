And everybody clapped?! WTF??!! Lol"</p><p>Another wrote: "The confidence in that man makes it a lot funnier lmao."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/see-family-feuds-worst-answers-842991204.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/see-family-feuds-worst-answers-842991200.jpg><h2>'PORK-UPINE'</h2><p>In 2012, Steve asked a contestant named Will to: “Name something that follows the word 'pork.'”</p><p>Answers like "-loin" had already been guessed correctly, but without a moment of doubt, he answered: "upine."</p><p>Harvey asked: "Huh?"</p><p>Will repeated the word “upine” repeatedly, as the audience burst out laughing and his family cheered: "Good answer."</p><p>Steve looked up and down at his cue card and said: "He said 'cupine.' What?! What is 'cupine.'"</p><p>He sarcastically ruled: "This is the greatest answer I’ve ever heard, I feel you. It's gonna be number one - on YouTube!"</p><p>“You're the only person that said 'cupine,'" the comedian-turned-beloved host continued to heckle.</p><p>"That porcupine answer never gets old," one YouTuber recently appreciated, as naturally, all these clips have made their way to viral status.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/see-family-feuds-worst-answers-842991202.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/see-family-feuds-worst-answers-842991196.jpg><h2>FRENCH FRIED</h2><p>In 2018, Steve tasked the two players at the buzzer to ring in first, and whoever got the top answer would get the round.</p><p>The prompt was: "Name a country a man with a mustache should visit to meet a woman with a mustache."</p><p>Nathan buzzed in first and said: "<a href=#>France</a>," on the board with eight responses from the survey.</p><p>His rival Darrell then buzzed in to try and steal by guessing: "Paris."</p><p>Paris is in France, so Darrell's guess didn't quite map out.</p><p>The crowd lost it, and Steve put his arm around poor Darrell.</p><p>"Don't even worry about this, let's - you go back to your spot," Steve comforted not even needing to see if it was up there.</p><p>However, Darrell still wanted to see if Paris was on the board, which it was not.</p><p>One fan reacted under its YouTube clip: "That fact that he wanted to check the board is the funniest part."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/see-family-feuds-worst-answers-842991197.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/see-family-feuds-worst-answers-842991201.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/see-family-feuds-worst-answers-842991192.jpg><h2>LEFT ON READ</h2><p>In 2014, contestant Rell was asked to: “Name something that’s hard to do with your eyes open.”</p><p>“Read," he guessed - which just didn't make sense at all.</p><p>Steve walked directly to the front of the stage and pointed to Rell's mother, who was in the audience.</p><p>The camera hilariously cut to his mom looking disappointed.</p><p>Harvey returned to the contestant, saying, “This boy [is] in college.</p><p>"He's enrolled there now. He leaned into the mic and said, 'Read,' Steve!"</p><p>“Okay. I sure want to see you shut your eyes and do it!” the host added.</p><p>Once more, the answer got the giant X and buzzer sound, and fans were left buzzing about it when the <a href=#>game show</a> once more shared it on YouTube.</p><p>"Steve looking at the mother in the audience, 'Yep, this your son,' just priceless," one fan wrote.</p><p>"I laughed so freaking hard at this today. That was one the worst answers I have ever heard," wrote another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/see-family-feuds-worst-answers-842991193.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/see-family-feuds-worst-answers-842991190.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-06-at-6.33.30-PM.png><h2>PRESIDENT VIAGRA</h2><p>In 2010, the iconic host <a href=#>immediately roasted contestant Dirk's wrong answer to an NSFW prompt.</a></p><p>"Name someone a man might not want to know that he uses Viagra," Steve asked.</p><p>"I would say the president of the United States," Dirk confidently guessed as his family clapped.</p><p>The decisive "X" appeared on the screen, and the camera cut to Steve, who looked beside himself.</p><p>"That was, by far the suckiest answer I've heard since I've been the host," he roasted.</p><p>"He's got two wars, a bad economy, an oil spill. He ain't worried about you using no Viagra," Steve continued to roast, referring to then-president <a href=#>Obama</a>.</p><p>"In the Oval Office today," Steve continued to riff. "So many decisions today, oh my God, is Dirk on Viagra?!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-06-at-5.48.43-PM.png><h2>'STEVE'S REACTIONS MAKE THE SHOW'</h2><p>Fans recently appreciated how the host handled bad answers with stoic aplomb when Family Feud uploaded the best-of-the-worst into <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one winnin</a><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>g</a><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> video.</a></p><p>One fan commented: "I gotta admit Steve does a pretty damn good job at hosting this show."</p><p>Another wrote: "It's not the crazy answer that gets me. It's Steve's facial expression after he hears something ridiculous. That's what gets me bursting into laughter."</p><p>A third wrote: "Steve has the energy of a teacher who's sick and tired of students not reading the instructions all the way through."</p><p>And a fourth: "I love that even tho it's the worst, most stupid answer, the family still claps and says 'good answer, good answer, it's up there.'"</p><p>"Steve Harvey is the reason Family Feud is still relevant," wrote a fifth.</p><h2>STEVE'S WINNING LIFE STORY</h2><p>Steve is a&nbsp;<a href=#>comedian&nbsp;</a>famed for the&nbsp;<a href=#>Miss Universe</a>&nbsp;competition and a long list of TV shows, including The Steve Harvey Morning Show, The Steve Harvey Talk Show, and Little Big Shots.</p><p>He has also appeared in movies, including Racing Stripes, Love Don’t Cost A Thing, and You Got Served.</p><p>Steve was born in Welch, West Virginia, on January 17, 1957, to coal miner dad Jesse Harvey and mom Eloise Vera.</p><p>But Steve's early days in showbiz didn't come easy.</p><p>The multi-talented TV personality once shared his struggles on&nbsp;<a href=#>Hoda Kotb</a>'s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Making Space</a>&nbsp;podcast.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=#>an emotional interview</a>, the star explained that in 1985, he won $50 at his first-ever try at stand-up comedy.</p><p>"I went to work the next day, quit my job," he told Hoda. "Told everyone I was a professional comedian."</p><p>"And you just kept at it?" Hoda asked.</p><p>"Well, I became homeless," Steve said flatly. "I was living in a car for three years."</p><p>He added: "I never believed in a plan B. Everybody that I know that has had a plan B has had to use it.</p><p>"Because if you have a plan B, you can’t give your all to plan A."</p><p>Steve has since made it in comedy and then some - he's a household name.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He reportedly makes $10million per year hosting Family Feud, according to <a aria-label="International Business Times.

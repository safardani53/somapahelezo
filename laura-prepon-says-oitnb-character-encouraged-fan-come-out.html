And to watch my character give her the courage to make this huge decision to tell her family about her orientation, like that is huge to me.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Roy Rochlin/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I mean, as this just wasn’t already worth it being on, so let’s just put on the whole show that transcends boundaries,” she adds. “To have that, is what it really is about. This just happened, like literally a few days ago. So, that type of thing means so much to me. The fact that people feel represented from the show is huge. It’s not just a job, it really is something bigger than that, and it’s incredible.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">OITNB‘s final season follows Piper (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Schilling</a>) struggling to adjust to life outside of prison.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the show’s official season 7 synopsis reads, “Taystee’s friendship with Cindy still hangs in the balance as her life sentence looms, Gloria and her kitchen staff are confronted by the harsh realities of Polycon’s newest profit stream, while others chase drugs or dreams and grapple with the reality of their place in this world.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The final season of a show is always really difficult to wrap up all the storylines, and to make sure the fans feel fulfilled and that we all feel fulfilled after spending so much time with these characters,” Prepon says. “I am really proud of our last season, I think the writers and the actors and the crew and everybody just did such a great job because that’s a lot of pressure.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Yael Stone, Natasha Lyonne and Laura Prepon on Orange Is the New Black.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>JoJo Whilden/Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Alex and Piper (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Schilling</a>) specifically are dealing with their relationship now that she’s on the outside and what comes with that.

Because the cast and the crew does become your second family, you’re there all the time, you spend so much time with these people and you create these really strong bonds. So when it’s ending, it’s sad. It’s a loss for sure.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She adds: “But there’s so many great relationships that I’ll take from the show and there’s so many wonderful experiences. I just knew what to prepare myself for because of ’70s. And I knew we’d all be crying and really it is a loss, but it was so wonderful. “It’s been an incredible experience.

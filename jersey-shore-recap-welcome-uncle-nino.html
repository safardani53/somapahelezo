Nope.</p><p>With Vinny’s hilarious uncle, Nino!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>The latest installment of this MTV franchise took us back to <a href=#>Mike’s wedding day</a>, specifically the reception and even more specifically the fallout from absolutely everyone getting totally wasted.</p><p>This included Uncle Nino, who chose to corner Ronnie’s baby mama and ask about all the stories he had been hearing and reading about on the World Wide Web.</p><p>At one point during the alcoholo-fueled evening, Jen found herself alone at the table with Uncle Nino — who had been pounding wine since the moment arrived.</p><p>Deena Cortese and her husband, Chris, were close by.</p><p>And so were network cameras…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Jen, Jen," Nino said to Harley.</p><p>"Ronnie is sweetheart. I know he adores you. Adores you. Adores. He’s a good, a good, a good soul. A beautiful soul. He doesn’t care about any other women. They don’t exist."</p><p>(Doesn’t care about other women, huh? They don’t exist, you say? <a href=#>These are questionable statements</a>.)</p><p>Deena and Chris didn’t even try to keep a straight face upon hearing this claim, busting out with laughter as footage of Ronnie bringing home that busty blonde from Miami last year&nbsp; flashed across the screen.</p><p>Jen didn’t find it as hilarious, though. She simply rolled her eyes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/pauly-to-the-d-705x1024.jpg><p>Nino was on a roll by now, however. There was no stopping his analysis of Jen and Ronnie’s very rocky and sometimes violent romance.</p><p>"But [I’m] a little puzzled," he continued, even though Harley was visibly annoyed.</p><p>"My opinion — I’ve been watching TMZ. You’re beating, you’re beating up on him? On my boy? What’s that all about?"</p><p>"It fake news," Jen replied.</p><p>"Fake news, my balls!" Nino fired back. "Stop beating on him! You keep f–king him up! He loves you! He f–king loves you!"</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Harley asked, her voice getting louder.</p><p>"Why’d you beat up on him?" Nino persisted, to which Jen replied, "Ask him."</p><p>(NOTE: You can read all about at least one of these Jen beatdowns <a href=#>HERE</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Nino, unafraid of Harley’s wrath, only got more fire up as the conversation continued.</p><p>"Leave him alone. He loves you! He’s a dynamite kid!" he yelled. "Leave him the f–k alone! You get him so tense, it’s like, ‘Uncle Nino, I don’t know what the f–k to do!’"</p><p>"He’s asking you for advice?" Harley responded, genuinely perplexed.</p><p>"Yes," Nino replied. "Don’t take advantage of his love, ya know? Ah, va fungool! Stop beating him up! Stop beating him up! Jen, really."</p><p>At this, Jen left the table.</p><p>But the awkwardness and drunken hilarity continued, as The Situation’s friends actually got up and gave speeches at the wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We must go ahead and thank TMZ for transcribing these toasts, starting with sage words of beauty from Ronnie:</p><p><strong>It is an honor to be here. I actually never thought I’d be involved in a special day of yours that didn’t involve Karma or Bamboo, but it is a pleasure and an honor to be here and be a part of this special day for the beginning of your life and long journey together.</strong></p><p><strong>I’ve known you for 10 years.</strong></p><p><strong>You’re my family, you’re my brother and you really are an inspiration to me and everybody here to show that there is positive in the world and that everybody can change for the better.</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong><strong>nd I love you every day more and more.</strong></p><a href=#><img width=639 height=558 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/02/ronnie-looks-sad.jpg alt="Ronnie Looks Sad" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Reveals Rehab Stint, Admits Hitting Rock Bottom</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>And what did Vinny say?</p><p><strong>All I want in life is somebody to look at me the way Mike looks at a food menu. You guys should see the party favors! On the way out, everybody is getting a horse’s head! I knew she was gonna say yes because a real Italian wife never folds under questioning.</strong></p><p><strong>I’m here all night.</strong></p><p><strong>Nah, but seriously, guys, I can’t think of a more amazing couple. Me and Mike have a favorite quote: "A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor." And through love, perseverance and strength, you guys have weathered every storm possible.</strong></p><p><strong>And as Mike would say, "Now, you are the storm," and there’s nothing that can stop you guys.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>For his part, Pauly got a bit sentimental:</p><p><strong>Lauren, you stuck by him through his good times, his bad times, his hard times, his fun times. You’re his soulmate.</strong></p><p><strong>And when I met you, Lauren, for the first time, I knew right away that you were the one for Mike. I saw exactly what he saw in you instantly — that pure heart.</strong></p><p><strong>It’s very hard to find. Believe me, I’m looking! I can’t find it. Trust me. There’s not many out there. I’m single!</strong></p><p>Finally, we close with the groom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Mike got married right before heading to prison for tax evasion, and he closed the episode with a message about grace and love and romance… as only The Situation can.</p><p>"In a couple months, I have to do my time and pay my debt to society," he said.</p><p>"My days is numbered right now. Some people focus on the negative, but Big Daddy Sitch focuses on the positivity.</p><p>"There’s something special about everyone under one roof celebrating my big day today. It’s like a fairy tale, it really is."</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Jersey Shore: Battered Ronnie Lies to Protect Jen Harley AGAIN For Some Reason!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WFcLbEq6qesV2otbC%2BxGapnpuRpXq4scucpqadXaq7pLjEZqWipp9k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The rapper was seen going out to dinner at Cesar Restaurant in Paris, France in an amazing purple getup that would make the purple rain king <strong>Prince</strong> proud! Her outfit, which showed off her incredibly fit figure, included a long-sleeved purple latex coat dress that had a plunging neckline that revealed a lot of cleavage and a wrap-around style at the waist. She paired the look, designed by <strong>Nicolas Jebran</strong>, with matching purple latex thigh-high heeled boots with a pointy toe and styled her shoulder-length hair straight and parted in the middle. The “Bodak Yellow” creator also had her long nails colored maroon and kept her makeup light but flattering.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Cardi’s latest outing comes in the middle of Paris Fashion Week.

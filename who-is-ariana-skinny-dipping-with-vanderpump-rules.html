Needless to say, she was devastated.</p><p>In the latter half of Season 10, she confronts Tom about his infidelity. During their heart-to-heart, Tom says he wished that they had fought harder for their relationship. Ariana, on the other hand, is over it. This becomes clear later in the trailer when she’s caught frolicking buck-naked with a man that many assume is her new love interest.</p><p>However, the tea isn’t as hot as you think.</p><p>While the couple’s skinny-dipping session looked pretty steamy, it was strictly platonic.

In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>, Brett confirmed that he and Ariana are just friends. And because he isn’t interested in women, it’ll stay that way.</p><p>“It’s me, hi. I am the one naked in the pool with Ariana and I am gay, so I’m glad we could clear that up,” he said in the video. He went on to encourage viewers to tune in to see what happens next.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In the comments, he clarified that the skinny-dipping scene was filmed before Ariana found out about Tom and Raquel, so it’s pretty clear that the clip was only included in the trailer to stir up some drama.

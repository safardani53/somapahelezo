During the interview, the host called Bosworth and Long, 44, “the ultimate couple you root for.”</p><p>“He loves you so much,” Bosworth responded. “He just loves you, so, so, deeply.”</p><p>The <a href=#>He’s Just Not That Into You</a> costars dated on and off <a href=#>from 2007 to 2010</a>. Two years after their split, Barrymore tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>Will Kopelman</strong></a>, with whom <a href=#>she shares daughters</a> Olive, 10, and Frankie, 9. The two <a href=#>called it quits</a> after four years of marriage in 2016.</p><p>Long, for his part, was linked to <a href=#><strong>Kirsten Dunst</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kate Mara</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Amanda Seyfried</strong></a> and <strong>Lauren Mayberry</strong> before connecting with Bosworth on the set of their 2022 thriller, <a href=#>House of Darkness</a>.

Right? It’s the time in your life where you’re just like, ‘I want to, like, feel. I want to do everything, I wanna just, like, be a part of the adventure in like a wild way,’ which is so much fun. And <a href=#>he just loves you so much</a>.”</p><p>During <a href=#>the former couple’s TV interview</a>, Barrymore described their past relationship as “hedonistic,” stating, “We would get together, we would break up.

During the season 10 premiere of <a href=#>Married to Medicine</a>, Toya did exactly that when arguing with <a href=#>Quad</a>. She suggested that Quad, whose full name is Quadriyyah Webb-Lunceford, got a DUI. In fact, Toya even told viewers at home to Google the information.</p><p>If you have seen that episode, then you might have done exactly that. So, is there any evidence that Quad actually got a DUI? What exactly was Toya talking about? Here's what we know.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Quad from 'Married to Medicine' get a DUI?</h2><p>It's certainly possible that, at some point in her life, Quad has got a DUI. If that did happen, though, it isn't something that has ever been made public on the internet. It seems like whatever may have happened with Quad, any issue with alcohol and a vehicle happened long ago. Toya's insistence that the audience Google "DUI Quadriyyah Webb-Lunceford" was all for naught, at least in terms of helping viewers find information about a DUI.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's also possible that Toya was mistaken or simply making the allegation up. As Phaedra says during a confessional, “It’s not OK to put a DUI on a good, Christian woman.” It may not be OK, but it's also just a pretty weird move, all things considered. Whatever the explanation might be for Toya's allegation, it doesn't appear to be readily available on the internet.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Quad has been largely MIA.</h2><p>In addition to her potential drinking and driving problems, the other reason Quad came up in the Season 10 premiere was because of her absence. Although she's still on the show, several other cast members discussed how absent she was from most of the episode, in large part because she seems to be keeping her distance following the show's most recent reunion special.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>As is the case on any great reality TV show, though, Quad won't be able to stay away from the drama for long. Previews for upcoming episodes suggest that she'll be a part of Lateasha’s bachelorette festivities. Her name is also invoked repeatedly throughout the episode, often by Heavenly, one of the new cast members who joined the show in Season 10.</p><p>In just one episode, Heavenly manages to suggest that Quad is sleeping with men who are already in relationships, and that she's a bad cook. All of that is on top of the allegations that she's a reckless driver. Before too long, Quad will need to be a more active participant just to defend her own honor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpsKisIymmKuqmZqxbsDOZqSenJmYtq%2BxjJ2sog%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

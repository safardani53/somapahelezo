That’s okay — Jana helped forge that association.</p><p>But while cheating is a heartbreaking betrayal, there are worse partners. Some deeds are not hurtful, but evil.</p><p>When Jana was a young adult, she met an older man.</p><p>In a heartfelt post for a great cause, she opened up about how he slowly revealed himself to be a monstrous abuser.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Please be advised that this discussion involves <strong>graphic descriptions of domestic violence and partner abuse</strong>.</p><p>Jana Kramer shared this throwback photo on Instagram.</p><p>“This is a very hard photo for me to look at,” Jane Kramer admitted in her caption.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/jana-kramer-and-gleb-savchenko-1024x711.jpg><p>“One might look at this and see two smiling faces,” Jana wrote. “A daughter with her mom.”</p><p>She acknowledged: “But what was under the smile is something that I still to this day have a hard time talking about.”</p><p>“I don’t remember the excuses that I told people,” Jana wrote, “when I flew home to escape my abuser.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jana knows that she must have made excuses “about the cuts and scrapes on my shoulder and arms.”</p><p>She added “or why my ribs were hurting.”</p><p>“But when I look at this photo,” Jana wrote in reflection, “that’s all I see.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jana described: “I see a broken girl who was weeks prior pinned to the ground.”</p><p>This, she revealed, was “while the man that ‘loved’ me was strangling me saying that he was going kill me.”</p><p>Jana expressed: “I was so full of shame.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I was made to feel like I had no one, and no one would believe me,” Jana noted. It is an all-too-familiar experience for survivors.</p><p>“And,” she continued, “that the reason I would be choked or hit was because I was bad.”</p><p>At the time, Jana felt “That I was wrong and I deserved it. For years I have held on to those beliefs.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jana then vowed that “one day soon I will speak more on the abuse that followed that one.”</p><p>“And the patterns that continued,” she continued, “but to be honest it’s been a journey.”</p><p>Jana acknowledged “and one I’m still trying to walk through knowing that wasn’t the last abusive relationship.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“One of the hardest rocks I threw into the stream when I was at on-site was the rock ‘I deserve abuse,'” Jana noted.</p><p>This, she explained, was “because for so long that’s what I thought.”</p><p>Jana admitted: “I held onto that for years thinking that was true. That’s what I was made to believe.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Now, Jana wrote, “I speak out to help others and to hopefully help at least one person who is reading this to talk to someone.”</p><p>In all caps, she correctly affirmed: “YOU DO NOT DESERVE ABUSE.”</p><p>Jana elaborated: “You do not deserve any form of abuse…physically, sexually, mentally, verbally, financial, emotionally abusive relationships etc.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“THAT IS ALL ABUSE,” Jana noted, assuring survivors and current victims: “There are people who want to be there for you.”</p><p>“That are there for you,” she emphasized. “Please don’t wait until you lose your breath.”</p><p>Jana expressed: “Your life, Your heart, your soul is meant to be here and is meant to be loved and cherished.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“I am linking in my bio a place to find help. @safehorizon and so many places are there for you,” Jana wrote.</p><p>She concluded her heartfelt caption: “Please talk to someone.”</p><p>Jana then linked to <a href=#>safehorizon</a> here. Like Jana, we encourage anyone experiencing abuse to reach out to trusted loved ones for help and support. You deserve better.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z9cLbAp5hmo6KWuqa%2BjKucnJmcocBurcGuqqKulWKyuXnBqLCfqpmau6V51qGmZqyYp7KiwMSnnJ1lpKR6prrDZp%2Beql2htqexjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

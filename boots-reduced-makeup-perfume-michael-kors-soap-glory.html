Eyeshadow palette was £2, everything else was £1.”</p><p>And she had a further bit of good luck when she went to the tills and realised she could use her Boots Advantage point.</p><p>She wrote: “I paid with points as well so it was all free.”&nbsp;</p><p>Boots fans were very impressed with their fellow bargain hunters and took to both posts in the group to congratulate them on their finds.</p><p>Several social media users also said they would be heading to the nearest Boots to them to see if they could have similar success.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.

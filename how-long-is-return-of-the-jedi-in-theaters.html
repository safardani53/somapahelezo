The best way is to check <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fandango</a> for nearby local participating theaters.</p><p>If you happen to be in Hollywood on Return of the Jedi's 40th birthday, you can check out a special screening of the film at the legendary <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">El Capitan Theatre</a>.

Absolutely amazing to carry on what we started with The Empire Strikes Back… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qwg7uuiwd6</a></p>— Matt Ferguson (@Cakes_Comics) <a href=#>April 8, 2023</a></figure><p>Matt also noted, "For [the Empire Strikes Back poster], a cold mechanical vibe completely takes over the whole composition. But Return of the Jedi is very much the triumph of Luke and the Rebels, so I wanted to have more of the warmer colors coming back into the art, hence pivoting to green with red accents .... Will Luke be turned? Is Vader going to overcome the darkness? It’s all about the pull between good and evil."</p><p>Return of the Jedi hits theaters (again) on April 28 to May 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecuopaBlmah6s7HTrqmnZZ%2BberW0xGahnpyZYravedOhnJqslafA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

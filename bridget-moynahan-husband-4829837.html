The actress and businessman have shared snippets of their lives on social media since the start of their relationship, but have also maintained privacy. From meeting in the 2010s to walking down the aisle in a secret ceremony, these lovebirds have memorable moments that will live forever.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Find our more about Andrew, his commitment with Bridget, and Bridget’s past love, Tom Brady, below.</p><h2>Andrew reportedly gave Bridget a dreamlike feeling when they met.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Bridget-Moynahan-Andrew-Frankel-BG-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although it’s unclear exactly where or when they met, it was sometime in the early 2010s, and the hunk, who is a renowned New York businessman, apparently made Bridget feel like she was “on cloud nine” around the time. “They met each other through a friend,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a source told PEOPLE</a>, “and she has been on cloud nine ever since.”</p><h2>When did they get engaged?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Bridget has kept the proposal private, but <strong>Basia Zamorska</strong>, one of her stylists, opened up about the engagement, in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> in 2015. “Andrew proposed to Bridget in April [2015] on a romantic getaway in Puerto Rico,” she told the outlet, adding that the engagement ring was a vintage one from Fred Leighton. “The diamond is set east-west, exactly what the bride has always wanted.”</p><h2>Andrew and Bridget got married in a secret ceremony in New York.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>The engaged couple went on to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>get married</a> at the Wölffer Estate Vineyard in Sagaponack, NY, on October 19, 2015, but it was a surprise, even to their guests. They invited their family and friends for what they believed would be a harvest moon ceremony, but it was soon revealed they were witnessing the reception for their actual nuptials. Only a handful of people went to the ceremony beforehand, including her son <strong>Jack</strong>, whom she shares with ex Tom.</p><h2>Bridget shared a gorgeous photo of her and Andrew from their wedding day in 2019.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Since she doesn’t share photos of Andrew often, the eye-catching post brought on a lot of joy and compliments. She shared it for their fourth wedding anniversary and it showed them <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posing</a> in their wedding attire while standing outside on green grass in the middle of rows of trees. Bridget wore a gorgeous white wedding dress and had her hair up while Andrew wore a classic suit and tie. “<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">Happy anniversary!” she captioned the pic.</span></p><h2>Do Bridget & Andrew have kids?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Bridget and Andrew don’t have any kids together, but Andrew became the stepfather of Bridget’s son Jack when they were married.

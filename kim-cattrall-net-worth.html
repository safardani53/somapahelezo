What is the Samantha actress’s net worth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>A new HBO series is bringing back some old favorites. <a href=#>And Just Like That</a>... is the <a href=#>Sex and the City</a> reboot we’ve all been waiting for, except there’s one major problem. <a href=#>Kim Cattrall</a>, who played Samantha in the original series, is not returning to the screen. For many viewers, Samantha was the character who made it OK to talk about sex.</p><p>Without Samantha, there’s basically no sex — it’s just the city. According to the writers, <a href=#>Samantha will be in London</a> for the entirety of the series, which leaves a door open for Kim to rejoin her ex-castmates (although that’s unlikely).</p><p>After contract disputes regarding pay for the Sex and the City films, Kim reluctantly participated in the movies. Now, people are wondering what her net worth is.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kim Cattrall has a net worth of approximately $40 million.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Kim’s net worth is approximately $40 million. So, it’s unlikely there’s a dollar amount that could convince her to join And Just Like That. Kim was on the stage and screen in the 1970s, so she had already amassed quite a bit of wealth before her breakout role as Samatha.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Kim Cattrall</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Actress</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $40 million</p><p>Kim Cattrall is a stage and screen actress famous for portraying Samantha in Sex and the City, for which she earned five Emmy nominations and four Golden Globe nominations. In 2003, Kim won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. Kim's 1975 film debut was in Rosebud, and she'll soon appear in How I Met Your Father.</p><p><strong>Birth date</strong>: August 21, 1956</p><p><strong>Birth place</strong>: Liverpool, England</p><p><strong>Birth name</strong>: Kim Victoria Cattrall</p><p><strong>Father</strong>: Dennis Cattrall</p><p><strong>Mother</strong>: Gladys Shane (née Baugh)</p><p><strong>Spouse(s): </strong>Larry Davis (1977-1979), Andre J. Lyson (1982-1989), Mark Levinson (1998-2004)</p><p><strong>Education</strong>: London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) and American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA)</p><p>However, since Sex and the City, Kim has been very public about her <a href=#>rivalry with co-star Sarah Jessica Parker</a>. Some fans think the feud comes down to money. Sarah was paid $1 million per episode at the height of Sex and the City, whereas Kim was only paid up to $350,000 per episode.</p><p>In addition, Kim negotiated a higher pay for the movies, but was still paid less than Sarah. Having said that, money isn’t the only reason for their bad blood.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kim Cattrall will likely never return to the ‘Sex and the City’ franchise because of a feud with Sarah Jessica Parker.</h2><p>It’s hard to figure out the truth behind their feud because both Kim and Sarah have conflicting accounts. In 2018, when <a href=#>Kim’s brother passed away</a>, she posted that she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t want Sarah’s condolences</a>. “I don’t need your love or support at this tragic time Sarah Jessica Parker,” her Instagram post read.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kim Cattrall (@kimcattrall)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now,” Kim wrote in the caption. “Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven’t already) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I’m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your ‘nice girl’ persona.”</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> article that Kim links to, she opens up about how she felt iced out by Sarah on set. Since then, Sarah has only said kind things about Kim publicly. Speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Sarah explained, “There was no fight; it was completely fabricated, because I actually never responded. And I won’t, because she needed to say what she needed to say, and that is her privilege.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>So although there’s no way of knowing the entire truth, the odds of Kim making an appearance in And Just Like That are pretty slim. But between her net worth and future projects, Kim seems to be doing just fine.</p><p>And Just Like That premieres on HBO on Dec. 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLauecKaq62qkaG5brrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

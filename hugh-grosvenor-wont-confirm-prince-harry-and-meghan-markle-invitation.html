He is the godson of Charles, 75, and had an official role at the <a href=#>monarch’s coronation</a> in May. Grosvenor’s mother, meanwhile, is a godmother to William, 41. Meghan and Harry also selected Grosvenor as one of the godparents for their son, Archie, 4. (The duo also share daughter Lilibet, 2.)</p><p>According to the newspaper, the decision to exclude Harry and Meghan was made due to the <a href=#>ongoing rift</a> between him and William. Tension between the royal brothers escalated after Harry and Meghan <a href=#>stepped down</a> from their roles as senior working members of the British royal family in early 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Hugh-Grosvenor-s-Spokesperson-Won-t-Confirm-If-Prince-Harry-and-Meghan-Markle-Are-Invited-to-Wedding-782.jpg><p>The brothers’ relationship grew more fractured after Harry spoke out about his royal experiences in the Netflix docuseries <a href=#>Harry & Meghan</a> and his bombshell memoir, <a href=#>Spare</a>. In the tell-all, Harry wrote candidly about his ups and downs with William, including a <a href=#>physical fight</a> that allegedly occurred after William called Meghan “difficult” and “rude.”</p><p>“It all happened so fast. So very fast,” Harry wrote about the 2019 incident. “He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor. I landed on the dogs’ bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Royal expert <strong>Omid Scobie</strong> claimed in his new book, <a href=#>Endgame</a>, that William felt his brother and Meghan “blindsided the family” with their public comments about the institution. Scobie further alleged that William “<a href=#>no longer even recognizes</a>” his younger brother, claiming that the twosome have had “minimal contact” since they both attended their grandmother Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral in September 2022.</p><p>The brothers most recently reunited in May for Charles’ coronation. The pair didn’t interact much at the event, as they <a href=#>sat in separate sections</a>. Harry, meanwhile, <a href=#>left London</a> as soon as the coronation ended so he could return home for Archie’s birthday, which fell on the same day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahrZedeqi%2Bzqytnqafp3q4u82tZJynnpu2s7mMqamippOaeqmt0auwZpmemXquscahmKdlnZa%2FrLjEZqCnrpmprrW1zqdm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

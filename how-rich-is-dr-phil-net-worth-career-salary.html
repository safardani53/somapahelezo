Oprah first met the host when she engaged his legal consulting business to help her prepare for her 1998 court battle against a group of Texas cattlemen over her statements regarding meat in relation to mad cow disease.</p><p>The host’s presence was so successful that he started appearing on the talk program on a weekly basis as a romance and life strategy expert.

But he wasn’t having it and he breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the goat’s carcass being dragged off to the side of the pitch.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The problem was it was still there during the game and when Saunders chased a ball down the touchline he lost his footing after a tackle and slid, face first, through a pool of the goat’s blood and straight into the carcass of the animal itself.</p><h3><strong>He was a very quick thinker…</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452439588.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452440300.jpg><p>During his short time at Sheffield United, Saunders produced one of the most ingenious bits of improvisation ever seen in the English game, and you can find it on YouTube.</p><p>In a match against Port Vale, he and Vale keeper Paul Musselwhite chased down a through ball and though Musselwhite beat him to it on the left touchline, knocking it out for a throw-in, Saunders was alive to the opportunity.</p><p>As the keeper raced back to his goal and without any of his team nearby, Saunders simply threw the ball against Musselwhite’s back and then rolled the ball into the empty, unguarded net.</p><h3><strong>But he could also score worldies…</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000000832595.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452438182.jpg><p>Picture the scene.

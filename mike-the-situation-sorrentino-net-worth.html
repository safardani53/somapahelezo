Per Celebrity Net Worth, Mike was raking in roughly $150,000 per episode of Jersey Shore and had a net worth of a whopping $10 million.</p><p>However, that all changed when a string of bad investments and poor planning left Mike in a financial hole after he didn't pay taxes on roughly $9 million worth of income. The star was accused of filing millions of dollars of phony business expenses as well as opening a series of bank accounts where he only deposited money in increments of less than $10,000 in hopes that the IRS wouldn't notice.</p><p>On Oct. 5, 2018, Mike was indicted in Newark, NJ., in the tax fraud case and was handed down a sentence of eight months in prison, two years of supervised probation, and 500 hours of community service. His brother, Marc "The Man" Sorrentino, who was his manager and partner, was also charged in the case. Mike served his sentence in the Otisville Federal Correctional Institution, where he was incarcerated from January 15, 2019, to September 12, 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforassYytn55lo57Btq3ToqanZaOkv7Oxza2gp6ddo7K1edaoqa2g</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

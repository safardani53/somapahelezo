But as of now.</p><p>We want to share the absolute answer to this question, which is that Chanel West Coast is a heterosexual woman and not a transgender person.</p><p>Here is our top-notch proof of that.</p><p>Chanel shared this in her Twitter feed after baseless rumours spread about her.</p><p>I got news for all these dumb sites that posted that ad saying I’m transgender and used to be Minkus: you’ve got a big lawsuit coming your way!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_do_People_Think_Chanel_West_Coast_is_Transgender></span>Why do People Think Chanel West Coast is Transgender?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chanel-west-coast-was-a-guy-rumors.jpg><p>There are a lot of reasons why people think she is transgender. The rumor began after a photo of Minkus from Boy Meets World was shown next to her image.</p><p>Some websites spread the collage and spread false information about her gender.</p><p>Aside from this, there are also more reasons why she is known as transgender. Let’s know them.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chanel_West_Coast_and_Lee_Norris></span>Chanel West Coast and Lee Norris<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Is-Chanel-West-Coast-a-Transgender-Person.jpg><p>There is a news story and meme shared on the internet with the Chanel West Coast photo and actor Lee Norris side by side, claiming that Lee Norris underwent sex-changing treatment and became “SHE” Chanel West Coast.</p><p>There is no basis for this rumour, which is also unfounded. We hope that some people started this rumour as a fun one.</p><p>However, if we look at the online photos, they appear to be identical, but this is due to the angle at which the picture was taken.</p><p>Some people cleverly chose those images and made a collage. But when we see the separate images of Chanel and Lee Norris, they look so different.</p><p>Thus, some opportunistic people tried to defame Chanel, and more people started believing it and reached out to help her come out as a transgender person.</p><p>“It is sad that I have these kids that feel like they can relate to me and stuff.” I’m a girl. I was born a girl. “This is a huge rumour, just like the Kidz Bop thing, and I’m trying to get all of that off the Internet.”</p><p>“Also, that hurts me too because I’ve had a lot of kids say, “I can relate to you,” thinking that I’m transgender, and I feel terrible.” I want to be like, “I’m not transgender,” but at the same time, I want to be there for people to feel like they can confide in me.</p><p>Chanel’s emotions are visible in these statements.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Proofs></span>Proofs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the next section, we will provide proof of our claim.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Chanel_West_Coasts_Husband></span>Who is Chanel West Coast’s Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chanel West Coast is not married yet, but she has been dating popular model and real estate agent Dom Fenison for a year.</p><p>They have known each other for many years, but they reconnected when Fusion acted in one of the channel’s music videos.</p><p>Chanel also started to see his romantic side and fell for him, and the couple started dating at the beginning of 2022.</p><p>This shows that Chanel is a heterosexual woman who loves guys.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Chanel_West_Coasts_Daughter_Name></span>What is Chanel West Coast’s Daughter Name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chanel West Coast welcomed her daughter Bowtie Fenison on November 7, 2022, through a c-section.</p><p>Thus, it clearly shows Chanel has a uterus to hold a baby!</p><p>If she were born a Lee Morris, she would not have female reproductive organs. And it is undeniable that Chanel is a woman.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Past_Relationship></span>Past Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chanel West Coast has dated a few men, and their details are,</p><p>When she was 19 years old, she dated a singer named Saul Garcia, but he was killed in a double homicide.</p><p>Chanel stated that his death was the most tragic event in her life.</p><p>Then, in 2014, she dated Chris Pfaff, the television personality.

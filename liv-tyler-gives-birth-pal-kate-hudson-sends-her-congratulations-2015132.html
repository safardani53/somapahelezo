In an adorable <a href=#>Throwback Thursday post</a> Feb. 12, Hudson shared a photo of her and Tyler from Tyler's first pregnancy. "#tbt to many years ago when @misslivalittle was preggers with Milo," Hudson posted. "Yesterday [she] welcomed a new baby boy! Congrats mama, I love you Shpooops!"</p><p>Growing up running in the same circles thanks to their famous parents, <strong><a href=#>Goldie Hawn</a> </strong>and <a href=#><strong>Steven Tyler</strong></a>, Hudson, 35, and Tyler, 37, attended the same high school, Crossroads School for Arts & Sciences, and went on to star together in Dr. T & the Women in 2000. Like Tyler, Hudson, who split from fianc√© <a href=#><strong>Matthew Bellamy</strong></a> in December, is also the mom of two boys, Ryder, 10, and Bingham, 3.</p><p>Tyler welcomed her new baby with her sports agent boyfriend, <strong>Dave Gardner</strong>, whom she met through mutual friend <a href=#><strong>Kate Moss</strong></a> and began dating last year. The couple's new arrival joins Tyler's 9-year-old son Milo, her child with ex <strong>Royston Langdon</strong>.</p><p>In a November 2014 interview with Town & Country, Tyler credited her second pregnancy with helping her live more in the moment. "It's fun not being on a diet or thinking, 'Oh my god, I have to go to SoulCycle every day,'" she told the mag. The "most fun thing," though? "Having those mom hormones flowing around," Tyler said. "You're more present in your body, and it's making me a better mother for Milo."</p><p>As Tyler's pregnancy progressed, it was especially clear that she felt comfortable in her skin, allowing pal <strong>Jemima Kirke</strong> to paint a portrait of her bare belly. "So much fun to be painted by a friend," the Leftovers actress wrote during her Brooklyn, N.Y. art session with Girls' Kirke.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaloaZiwbq4xKtkoKGmmsBursirq6FloJa5brfArZxmoKWZwLC6jKycp5yjYrWmvoycpqefopbBtrjAraCopqNif3F9lGpqa2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

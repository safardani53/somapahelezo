They dated for two years!</p><p>He was also discussed on an earlier episode in which Gates alleged that while they were dating, she caught him banging another woman.&nbsp;</p><p>At that point, Raven said, she attacked her beau with a high-heeled shoe, an image that brings a smile to our face (cheating aside).&nbsp;</p><p>Hunter’s definitely not among those laughing about it, however.</p><p>"Comments made by Raven about our relationship are skewed and untrue," Henry tells the website. "However, I wish her all the best."</p><p>"Definitely not true about the whole orgasm thing," he adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Sure man. You just keep telling yourself that okay?</p><p>"And she has told me she loved me multiple times," says Hunter, who’s in the running for Worst BF of the 2010s honors, "just for the record."</p><p>Anyone buying what Henry is selling here? Would The Bachelor actually invent wholesome, sweet <a href=#>Raven Gates’ "secret"</a>&nbsp;as a storyline?</p><p>Actually, they very well might, come to think of it …</p><p>We put nothing past Mike Fleiss and company, though at the same time it feels hard to believe Raven would go out and lie like that.</p><p>Right? Or would she do that if they told her to?</p><p>In any case, Bachelor Nation fans have been fascinated by Gates’ claim that she has never climaxed from any sort of sexual activity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>After the episode aired, a&nbsp;GoFundMe account popped up online seeking to raise money to buy the 25-year-old boutique owner a&nbsp;vibrator.</p><p>An&nbsp;altruistic endeavor if ever there were one.</p><p>Raven is one of&nbsp;Viall’s final three ladies, along with Vanessa Grimaldi and Rachel Lindsay, after he eliminated Corinne Olympios Monday.</p><p>(We imagine <a href=#>Corinne and her platinum vagine</a> have had about 14 orgasms, manually and/or with the aid of someone else, since then.)</p><p>It was during Gates’ overnight date with Nick that the topic of the Big O came up, and Viall was at a loss for words like the rest of us.</p><p>Gates had just come out of a bad breakup with Hunter Henry (never trust a dude with two first names) when she applied for the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She says she’s slept with only him (and apparently, he didn’t do a very good job of it), before meeting and building up their great chemistry.</p><p>Whether that’s enough to get her the final rose over Vanessa (we know Rachel is out) remains to be seen, along with any orgasmic action.</p><p>Monday’s episode left off with a mini-cliffhanger.</p><p>Raven ultimately accepted Nick’s invitation to the Fantasy Suite, where she met up with Viall and his uncomfortable looking turtleneck.</p><p>Did he ditch said sweater and become THE ONE to take Raven to the Oh-Zone for the first time in her life on that hot night in Finland?</p><p>Bachelor Nation can only hope.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Raven Gates Photos: Will She Win Nick Viall (and Bachelor Nation’s) Heart?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WAcL7Ar5ynZZeWwaa%2FjJ6vZpqfrrOztcSnm2ahXZyut7GMoZyrZZ%2BntKK%2FzKxkmqaUYsCpsYysmKKcXai1pnnLqK1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;

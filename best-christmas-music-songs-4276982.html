Holiday music comes in all sorts of different sounds. Whether it’s sweet and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>festive mood music</a> or <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebratory Christmas anthems</a>, there’s something for all moods and holiday parties! While getting last-minute Christmas presents wrapped, there’s nothing better to bring on holiday joy than putting on <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mariah Carey</a></strong>‘s Merry Christmas&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>album</a> or a holiday playlist to prepare for Christmas fun.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Some of the music’s biggest names have lent their voices to tracks that have become holiday favorites and Christmas classics. <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Demi Lovato</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Katy Perry</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>John Legend</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Toni Braxton</a>, Destiny’s Child, </strong>and <strong>The Jonas Brothers </strong>are just a few of your faves who have celebrated “the most wonderful time of the year” through song. If you’re looking to remember some of your favorite artists’ spins on holiday classics or new additions to your own holiday playlist, check out our list (maybe even do it twice), and get into the Christmas spirit. Happy Holidays!</p><h2>Mariah Carey, “All I Want For Christmas Is You”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>A “must-have” for any holiday pop playlist, Mariah Carey’s modern classic remains a beloved staple each Christmas season. It also continues to top the charts whenever December rolls around (In fact, as of Dec. 8, it’s No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.) In 2020, Mariah teamed up with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ariana Grande</a> </strong>and <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jennifer Hudson</a> </strong>for an updated version of her 2010 hit, “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oh Santa!</a>” so there’s plenty of Mariah for your playlists this Christmas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/favorite-christmas-songs-by-celebs-ap-images-embed.jpg><h2>Taylor Swift, “Christmas Tree Farm”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Any die-hard Swiftie will tell you how Taylor Swift spent ages five-to-ten living on a Christmas tree farm owned by her father. Those same Swifties will also pick Taylor’s 2019 song “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christmas Tree Farm</a>” as their favorite tune to listen to this year. Some might choose her version of <b>Wham’s</b>&nbsp;“Last Christmas” from her 2007 ep, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection.</p><h2>Ariana Grande, “Santa Tell Me”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Want more Ariana Grande for your holidays? The music star has released plenty of Christmas music, including her 2015 EP,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Christmas & Chill.</a> It’s actually her second holiday EP, following 2013’s Christmas Kisses. Sandwiched between those two is “Santa Tell Me,” like that special present hiding in the back under the Christmas tree.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/favorite-christmas-songs-by-celebs-ap-images-embed2.jpg><h2>Katy Perry, “Cozy Little Christmas”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Considering<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Katy </strong></a><b>Perry’s</b>&nbsp;love of crazy outfits, celebrations, and all things <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>camp</a>, it makes sense that she would have a very Katy Christmas song. The singer released “Cozy Little Christmas” in 2018 and followed up with a music video (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>which included reindeer massages</a>) in 2019.</p><h2>Justin Bieber, “Mistletoe”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>For many dedicated Beliebers, there’s nothing they would have wanted more than to meet <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Bieber </strong></a>under the “Mistletoe.” In 2011, the Canadian superstar released Under The Mistletoe, his second studio album and first collection of holiday songs. Since <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>then</a>, he’s gone on to marry <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong></a>, so expect them to smooch under the mistletoe this Christmas.</p><h2>John Legend ft. Stevie Wonder, “What Christmas Means To Me”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Stevie Wonder </strong></a>covered “What Christmas Means To Me” on his 1967 album, Someday At Christmas. So, when John Legend put <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>out A Legendary Christmas in 2018</a>, he called upon the music icon to join him and do the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>song</a> justice. It’s like Stevie was his Secret Santa.</p><h2>Jonas Brothers, “Like It’s Christmas”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>The Jonas Brothers – <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a>, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joe Jonas</a>, </strong>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kevin Jonas </strong></a>– are no strangers to Christmas music. A young “Nicholas” Jonas released “Joy To The World (A Christmas Prayer)” in 2003, and the JoBros released “Girl Of My Dreams,” a holiday-themed love song, in 2007. Fast forward to 2019, and the Brothers – all grown up and married – decided to gift their fans a song about how every day feels “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Like It’s Christmas</a>” when you’re in love.</p><h2>Gwen Stefani ft. Blake Shelton, “You Make It Feel Like Christmas”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Ever since striking up a romance in 2015, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gwen Stefani </strong></a>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blake Shelton </strong></a>have been partners in love and music. So, it made plenty of sense that Blake would pop up on Gwen’s 2017 holiday album, You Make It Feel Like Christmas. In fact, Gwen and Blake duet on the album’s title track and pack in the PDA in the official <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>music video</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/favorite-christmas-songs-by-celebs-ap-images-embed3.jpg><h2>Dolly Parton ft. Miley Cyrus, “Christmas Is”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>Surprisingly, it took until 2020 for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dolly Parton </strong></a>to release an album called <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A Holly Dolly Christmas</a>. It wasn’t her first <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>holiday</a> album – she and <strong>Kenny Rogers </strong>released Kenny & Dolly: Once Upon A Christmas in 1984, and she put out Home For Christmas in 1990 – but Holly Dolly is the only <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christmas</a> album of hers that features her godchild, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>.</p><h2>Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello, “The Christmas Song”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-24>There have been some incredible Christmas duets in the past: <strong>Bing Crosby </strong>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>David </strong></a><b>Bowie’s</b>&nbsp;iconic version of “Little Drummer Boy”; <strong>Tegan and Sara’s</strong>&nbsp;“Make You Mine This Season”; even <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Will Ferrell</a> </strong>and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Zooey </strong></a><b>Deschanel’s</b>&nbsp;shower version of “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” in Elf counts. So, when it came <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>time</a> for their Christmas duet, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shawn Mendes </strong></a>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Camila Cabello </strong></a>teamed up for “The Christmas Song.” While their romance has ended, their love for each other is captured on this track.</p><h2>Kelly Clarson ft. Reba McEntire & Trisha Yearwood, “Silent Night”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-26>There are plenty of selections for Wrapped In Red, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kelly </strong></a><b>Clarkson’s</b>&nbsp;2013 Christmas album, that would make your playlist all “merry and bright.” Considering her team-up with country music superstars <strong>Reba McEntire </strong>and <strong>Trisha Yearwood, </strong>for starters, as their three voices soar on “Silent Night.”</p><h2>Destiny’s Child, “Do You Hear What I Hear?”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-28>It might have been too on the (red) nose if Destiny’s Child called their 2001 Christmas album We Three Queens. Instead, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they</a> went with 8 Days of Christmas, and it’s full of songs that could be great additions to any playlist, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>including</a> their take on “Do You Hear What I Hear?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/favorite-christmas-songs-by-celebs-ap-images-embed1.jpg><h2>Toni Braxton, “Christmas Time Is Here”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-30>Toni Braxton gifted the world Snowflakes in 2001, a collection of holiday classics like “Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,” “This Time Next Year,” and her collab with <strong>Shaggy</strong>, “Christmas In Jamaica.” One of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gems</a> on this album is her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>version</a> of “Christmastime Is Here,” the <strong>Vince Guaraldi </strong>song made famous on A Charlie Brown Christmas.</p><h2>Jimmy Eat World, “Last Christmas”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-32><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>George Michael </strong></a>and <strong>Andrew Ridgeley </strong>carved their names into the Christmas Music Hall of Fame in 1984 when, as the musical duo <strong>Wham</strong>, they put out “Last Christmas.” Since then, the track has been covered by many acts, including <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hilary Duff,</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ashley Tisdale</a>, </strong>Ariana Grande, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Carly Rae Jepsen</strong></a>. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jimmy Eat World </strong></a>released their version of the song in 2001, and it’s become a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>staple</a> of their setlist whenever Christmastime rolls around.</p><h2>Lizzo, “Never Felt Like Christmas”</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-33><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lizzo</strong></a> has a Christmas song, everyone! She released “Never Felt Like Christmas” in 2015, and it’s perfect for those who never got into the holiday spirit – until they unwrapped the present that is love. “I never saw a miracle on 50-something Street,” she sings. “But now I’m singing, bells are ringing, everything is new / I’m fa-la-la-la-la-ling into love with you, ooh ooh oh, you / All these years, I’ve been let down until you came around / It never felt like Christmas.”</p><h2>Demi Lovato, “Wonderful Christmastime”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-35>Despite <strong>Anthony Fantano, </strong>aka “The Internet’s Busiest Music Nerd,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>despising it</a>, many people adore <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Paul </strong></a><b>McCartney’s</b>&nbsp;“Wonderful Christmastime.” And, like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Demi Lovato</strong></a>, many pop stars have decided to cover it. Demi’s version was part of the 2008 Hollywood Records comp, All Wrapped Up.</p><h2>Britney Spears, “My Only Wish (This Year”)</h2><p id=content-paragraph-37><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Britney Spears </strong></a>took a shot at becoming the Queen of Christmas with the release of “My Only Wish (This Year),” one of the songs on 2000’s Platinum Christmas. The compilation also featured <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Monica,</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christina Aguilera</a>, Dido,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Backstreet Boys,</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TLC</a>, </strong>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Whitney Houston</strong></a>. While “My Only Wish” failed to dethrone “All I Want For Christmas Is You” as the big pop song of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season</a>, it remains a fan favorite and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>deserves</a> a spin this year.</p><h2>Mary J. Blige, “My Only Wish (This Year)”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-39>Even <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mary J. Blige </strong></a>got in on the holiday action by releasing A Mary Christmas in 2013. The album featured appearances by <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jessie J</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Marc Anthony, </a></strong>and even <strong>Barbra Streisand</strong>. Yet, one of the best moments on the album is her version of <strong>Donny Hathaway’s</strong>&nbsp;“This Christmas,” a song that singer-songwriter <strong>Ben Rector </strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>described</a> as “jolly, “jazzy,” and “funky.” Mary’s version of the song is all that – and more.</p><h2>NSYNC, “Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-41>A little bit of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>boy band love</a> never hurt any Christmas, right? <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NSYNC</a> </strong>put out Home For Christmas in 1998, a seasonal album full of Christmas classics and a handful of holiday originals. One such song was the single, “Merry Christmas (Happy Holidays),” which has gone on to be covered by such groups as Pentatonix for their 2016 Christmas album, A Pentatonix Christmas.</p><h2>Sabrina Claudio ft. The Weeknd, “Christmas Blues”</h2><p id=content-paragraph-43><strong>Sabrina Claudio’s</strong>&nbsp;Christmas Blues got a special gift when she got <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a> to appear on the title track. It’s also a perfect song to put on when you want to turn the lights low and spend the rest of the evening staring at a fireplace with your special someone.</p><p id=content-paragraph-44>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Geqq1lk52%2Fqr%2FTppisZZ2qwKqvjKymp5%2BjYoFzg5Vyb2tn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

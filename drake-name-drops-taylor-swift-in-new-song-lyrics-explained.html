Initially, Her Loss was set to drop on October 28, 2022, but was moved a week later to November 4.<br>Swift’s Midnights had been released on October 21, 2023, and fans were quick to speculate that Drake moved his release to allow Swift, 33, more time on the charts.</p><p>While Midnights took over charts upon its release, Her Loss pushed it from No. 1 on the album chart in November 2022. That being said, Swift’s “Anti-Hero” was still in the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100, even after the release of Her Loss.</p><p>Upon sharing his successes, Drake did get backlash after fans were convinced <a href=#>he threw some shade</a> at Swift over her Billboard chart success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Drake-Explains-Why-He-Pushed-Album-Release-Date-While-Giving-Taylor-Swift-a-Shout-Out-Inline.jpg><p>In November 2022, he shared an Instagram Story revealing that Her Loss was dominating the Billboard Hot 100 and covered had up the title of “Anit-Hero” with a series of emojis. At the time, fans accused him of being “petty.”</p><p>This is hardly the first time Drake has pushed back one of his album releases. Earlier this year, something similar happened with his <a href=#>For the Dogs</a> album, which ended up being released around the same time as another one of Swift’s records.</p><p>Initially, the record was set to be released on September 22. However, Drake revealed that he needed more time to complete the album, moving the release date to October 6.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Okay my dilemma I am faced with is I either cancel shows to finish the album or I complete the mission and drop the album before the last show,” he wrote in a message to fans on September 16. “I owe you all these memories we are building and anywhere we have missed to date we will be spinning back for sure.”</p><p>Swift, for her part, dropped <a href=#>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</a> on October 27. With both album releases, Drake put two weeks between his and Taylor’s drops.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJurmZuaeq%2BtzJ5knaqfpcBuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTZqCnZZ6axG6%2FzqeeZqSpp7akv4yer6mkkZ67prCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

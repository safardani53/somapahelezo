Lizzo (n√©e Melissa Jefferson), her production company (Big Grrrl Big Touring, Inc.) and Lizzo's dance team captain (Shirlene Quigley) are all named in the papers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In it, the dancers ‚Äî <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams and Noelle Rodriguez </a>‚Äî alleged that they were pressured by Lizzo into touching nude performers while at a club in Amsterdam and were forced to endure weight shaming.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Lizzo.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lizzo TikTok</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the singer's lawyer claims she plans to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>countersue for the plaintiffs' alleged hypocritical behavior.</a> Lizzo's lawyer Marty Singer has previously shared photos with PEOPLE of plaintiffs Davis, Williams and Rodriguez allegedly "happily cavorting backstage" with performers from Crazy Horse's topless cabaret show on March 5, 2023 in Paris ‚Äî after they claimed Lizzo pressured them into attending the performance while on tour in the lawsuit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story ‚Äî sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Singer says: ‚ÄúThese irrefutable photos and videos, along with additional substantial evidence, prove the glaring contradictions between what the plaintiffs claim in their bogus lawsuit and what is actually proven by the facts. The lawsuit is a sham. Lizzo intends to sue for malicious prosecution after she prevails and these specious claims are dismissed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the lawsuit was filed earlier this month, Lizzo <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>responded to the claims</a> on social media, stating that she is ‚Äúnot the villain‚Äù and that the allegations being made against her were ‚Äútoo outrageous‚Äù not to address.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"About Damn Time"</a> singer said: ‚ÄúThese last few days have been gut-wrenchingly difficult and overwhelming disappointing." She continued: "My work ethic, morals and respectfulness have been questioned. My character has been criticized. Usually I choose not to respond to false allegations but these are as unbelievable as they sound and too outrageous not to be addressed.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5yex7u7jJ2cm62kqHqju8udZKedp2KvrbvNnZxmmZ6ZerG1zaRko52cocantdKhZKGZmad6eIWVbWdxaQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

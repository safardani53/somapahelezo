Everybody needs a prenup!” <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> told E! News in June 2011, referring to her then-husband, <a href=#><strong>Lamar Odom</strong></a>. “I mean, I don’t care if you make $5 or $5 million, in this day and age … people are crazy, you never know. And when you have businesses together, like we do, <a href=#>you have to protect yourself</a>. It doesn’t mean you don’t love them.”</p><p>A prenuptial agreement — or prenup — is a contract drawn up by the couple before they get married that typically lists their assets and specifies how everything will be divided up in the event of a divorce. However, they can also include specific mandates, like the “no cheating” clause that <a href=#><strong>Teresa Giudice</strong></a> had in her prenup with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Joe Giudice</strong></a>.</p><p>“A week before we were getting married, Joe asked me to sign a prenup and I just felt <a href=#>when you love someone, you don’t do that</a>,” she revealed on a January 2020 episode of <a href=#>Real Housewives of New Jersey</a>. “I didn’t even read it. I just said, ‘I want you to put one thing in there. If you ever cheat, the prenup is void.'”</p><p>Some celebrity couples, however, opt out of a prenup when they decide to tie the knot. “<a href=#>I wish I would have signed a prenup</a> [when I married <a href=#><strong>Nick Lachey</strong></a>],” <a href=#><strong>Jessica Simpson</strong></a> confessed during a February 2020 appearance on The Dr. Oz Show. “The funny thing is that Nick wanted me to sign a prenup, and I was so offended. I was like, ‘But we’re going to be together for the rest of our lives!'”</p><p>Occasionally, <a href=#>a couple’s whirlwind romance</a> gets in the way of their ability to sort things out in advance. When <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> and <a href=#>Hailey Bieber (née Baldwin)</a> secretly <a href=#>got married in a courthouse ceremony</a> in September 2018, a source told Us Weekly that they had reached out to lawyers about drafting a prenup, but there wasn’t enough time to get everything settled.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He was somebody I’d always cared about so deeply and loved very deeply,” Hailey told Elle in February 2020 about <a href=#>getting engaged to the “Yummy” singer</a> just one month after they reconnected in June 2018. “He’s an incredible, amazing man and <a href=#>such a good partner to go through life with</a>. There is no one else I would have ever wanted to spend my life with except him. So, I’m lucky.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn which celebrity couples did and did not have a prenup:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqypYrCwwc%2BlnKxlp57BqXnAp5tmr5mptbDB02anq52eqr21tcClZJqfopqyrrHNrapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

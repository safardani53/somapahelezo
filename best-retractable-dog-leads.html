Because of this, they're a great way to give you the safety of your dog being on a lead, while still giving them some independence to roam and explore.</p><p>Retractable dog leads can extend to anything from three metres up to eight metres, so it's entirely up to you how much free reign to give your four-legged friend.</p><p>They also come in a range of styles and designs, with features like a brake-and-lock system being key: after all, you're the one in control, so it's crucial you can use the brake safely without damaging the mechanism.</p><p>Comfort is also a massive factor when it comes to choosing a retractable dog lead. Staying tangle-free and avoiding the dreaded rope burn is massively important – so we've paid attention to the reviews of other shoppers to make sure we've selected the most durable and ergonomic models on the market.</p><p>Read on below to discover the best retractable dog leads, for all needs and budgets.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2>1.

The Flexi Xtreme Tape Leash is the one for you.</p><p>Designed "for everyone who loves extreme outdoor activities" (that's you and your canine, then), the integrated shock absorber will remove the strain from any sudden pulls by your dog.</p><p>And with reinforced tape, it promises to withstand intense use, so you can be completely confident that it'll hold up and in no way be flimsy.</p><p>Available in three sizes, it's suited to the smallest of dogs, right up to bigger dogs weighing up to 65kg.</p><h2>What to look for in a retractable dog lead?</h2><p>Durability is really important here, so pay attention to the lead itself and check to see if it's been made with strong material or features any reinforcements.</p><p>Likewise, you want to make sure that your retractable dog lead stays tangle-free, so look out for designs where the feeder has a 360-degree turn.</p><p>The locking mechanism also needs to be easy and simple to use with one hand, which will save you lots of faff.</p><p>Similarly, a handle that's been ergonomically designed will offer plenty of comfort – which is super important on any dog walk.</p><h2>Do retractable dog leads work?</h2><p>Retractable dog leads are designed to keep your dog close by and in your control, while still giving them plenty of freedom – so yes, they do work for that purpose.</p><p>However, they do of course have their downsides: flimsy designs can break, so it's best to make sure you choose something durable and robust.</p><p>Some dogs will unsurprisingly, learn that pulling helps to extend the lead, so it's generally best to use them on pets that have already been lead trained so that you're not constantly being yanked along.</p><h2>How thick should a dog lead be?</h2><p>Lead thickness mostly comes down to the size of your dog – but of course, it needs to be comfortable for you to hold too, without causing friction.</p><p>For smaller dogs, a lead width of half an inch or less is suitable, while for medium and large-sized dogs, stick to widths of around one inch.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2>Are retractable dog leads bad for big dogs?</h2><p>Retractable dog leads do carry dangers, so it's best to do your research – but overall they can still be suitable for big dogs.</p><p>Large dogs tend to pull on the lead more than smaller ones, so it's important to make sure that the lead you go for is designed for your dog's weight: you might even want to choose one that's suited for heavier dogs, to give you extra peace of mind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpwaG5%2FdXyVaJmeq6Riv6bA0ZqarZmSobJusM6gZKWdkZnAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

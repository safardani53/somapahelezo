Buddha is the executive chef at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Huso</a>, which is located inside Marky's Caviar retail shop, while Rebekah is the pastry sous chef at world-renowned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eleven Madison Park</a>.

"She would remind me of my dad's favorite quote, which is 'If you think you can, you can.' That's what my dad always told me at the end of every phone call. She's taken that position now, and it was very encouraging. She was definitely instrumental to the win, for sure."</p><p>Buddha is the latest chef to win the Bravo series, but it remains to be seen what exactly he'll do next. He is, however, definitely interested in <a href=#>returning to the show</a> in some capacity in the future.</p><p>"I'm looking forward to doing anything with Top Chef. I cannot speak highly of it enough. I think what they do is so important, not only just for the fans, but also for the industry," Buddha concluded. "They really try to showcase the industry in the best way. I'm really happy to be a part of it."</p><p>You can catch up on all 19 seasons of Top Chef on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl8KlsMeaZKWnXay2p7GMraapZZOdsqc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

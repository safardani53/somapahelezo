Would the real Ye please stand up? Please stand up..."</p><p>A third said: "Wait you criticized Kim for dressing half naked and your wife dresses like this? I really like you but this is a double standard. Your kids are going to see this…"</p><p>To which someone replied: "Yes, this isn’t Kanye. It really isn’t there is no way."</p><h2>SUSPICIOUS TIMING</h2><p>In terms of Kanye's ex, Bianca's IG Story share came shortly after some fans believed Kim was sending&nbsp;<a href=#>a subliminal message</a>&nbsp;Kanye's way.</p><p>Kim's since-deleted post also came as she raised speculation of trying to&nbsp;<a href=#>"one-up" her ex's new wife</a>&nbsp;in recent weeks.</p><p>Kim and Kanye filed for divorce in February 2021, and the rapper has since remarried his&nbsp;<a href=#>Yeezy architectural designer.</a></p><p><a href=#>The Kardashians</a>&nbsp;star took to her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;profile this week to share throwback snaps with her fans.</p><p>The photos showed the TV personality at a party she threw in 2016, wearing a matching taupe set with long sleeves.</p><p>Kim rocked honey blonde hair and full glam makeup as she smiled next to her mom&nbsp;<a href=#>Kris Jenner</a>, 67, and her younger sister&nbsp;<a href=#>Kendall,</a>&nbsp;27, in one of the pictures.</p><p>A second snap showed the&nbsp;<a href=#>Hulu</a>&nbsp;star sitting on the couch next to a male friend, laughing as he made a silly face at the camera.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Skims</a>&nbsp;founder looked extremely tan and polished in the pictures as she captioned her post: "Love finding old photos in my phone."</p><p>But fans noticed something odd about the memories, as one took to Reddit to remind others that they were taken at one of Kanye's birthday parties while the couple was still married.</p><p>"These pictures were from a party Kim threw for Kanye years ago," they wrote, adding another throwback from the same event.</p><p>"Not Kanye’s bday," a second trolled, while a third suggested: "She found them? As if she doesn't have them all categorized by date and event and designer etc."</p><p>"A party Kim threw for Kanye when they were together.....?" a fourth wondered.</p><h2>FAN THEORIES</h2><p>Other fans shared their theories on the photos, with one questioning: "Can someone tell me what Kim is doing? Is she trying for Kanye's attention does she miss him wtf is going on?"</p><p>"She posted then deleted his 41 birthday photos the list goes on. Seems she trying memory lane with him.</p><p>"She wearing Birkin bags he gifted her again, [the] list goes on and on. Signing and dancing to his music. I’m so confused? It’s whack."</p><p>A second person guessed: "I mean I think she thought she would get someone new after the divorce and now that it is crickets she wants to get back."</p><p>"She didn't realize how irrelevant she would become once they split up," a third slammed.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"What's hilarious is even if they got back together Kanye isn't taken seriously anymore so it wouldn't even help. She's truly in her Flop Era and there's no stopping it."</p><p>"She was wearing Yeezy slides the other day too," a fourth remembered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/kanye-wests-wife-bianca-censori-837011101-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/kanye-west-bianca-censori-seen-822051771-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/kanye-wests-wife-bianca-censori-837365532-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwaGiFdIOXaKKapqmaerix0q1ksKGWmnqjtcCnmpplk5q7tLvRomSfpJGqu7W%2FjK6lnZ2il7ywroyipayskZy%2FormO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

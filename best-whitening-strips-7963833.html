And, just like we might turn to at-home skin treatments for evening skin tone and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>erasing dark spots</a>, we can use at-home treatments, such as teeth whitening strips or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>LED whitening kits</a>, to target yellowing teeth and provide an overall brighter, whiter smile.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from lifting stains and achieving brighter pearly whites from home, the best reason to use teeth whitening strips is their convenience factor. Similar to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sheet masks</a>, these whitening strips are simple and easy to apply to the teeth — and most only require a 30-minute treatment time. Plus, you can get away with wearing them while going on with your daily activities.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, at-home teeth whitening strips are a cost-effective solution for achieving a whiter smile, as a majority of options cost less than $60 for a week’s worth of treatment. “The average cost of getting your teeth professionally whitened ranged from $650 to $1,000, and professionally-dispensed kits that you get from the dentist's office average $100 to $400,” says Brittany Ang, DMD, MDS, MBS, of Curve Orthodontics. She explains that, although an in-office whitening treatment is more involved, at-home whitening strips can yield effective results.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you experience tooth or gum sensitivity, Ang says at-home whitening strips can also be worth trying as they are typically designed with more gentle formulas. “Most at-home whitening strips use a hydrogen peroxide concentration under 16 percent, whereas in-office treatments use a concentration of 25 to 40 percent,” she explains. Because of this, Ang says patients with a history of tooth or gum sensitivity might have a more comfortable experience with at-home teeth whitening strips.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With all of these benefits to consider, it’s no wonder there are dozens of teeth whitening strips on the market. Our PEOPLE Tested team tried 16 different options from Amazon, Crest, Burst, and more to find the best options. Through the testing process, we carefully considered ease of use, value, comfort, and, of course, how effective they are at lifting away stains and whitening teeth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here are the best teeth whitening strips that PEOPLE tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-crest-3dwhitestrips-1-hour-express></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Crest 3DWhitestrips 1-Hour Express</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Crest 3DWhitestrips 1-Hour Express" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/39gpPArIw0-1YPSULcj_OjxlPuM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/crest-3dwhitestrips-1-hour-express-478d25a03fa0412bae21b4c888767502.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Convenience</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>They have a firm and tacky surface that sticks to the teeth well.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite working so quickly, they don’t cause teeth or gum sensitivity.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Due to the size and shape of the strips, they don’t touch the gums.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After testing 16 options, we found that the Crest 3DWhitestrips 1-Hour Express are the best at-home teeth whitening strips. These whitening strips are formulated with hydrogen peroxide and are designed as a quick solution to brighten teeth in just a single one-hour session. Upon our first test, we noticed a change in our teeth color, which was impressive for one-time use. However, we found that these Crest whitening strips were the most impressive after several uses as they effectively removed stains and made teeth whiter by six shades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the testing period, we found that one of the most impressive aspects of these strips — especially considering the one-hour treatment time — is the tacky surface, which sticks to teeth effectively for long periods of time. We also loved the shape and size of the strips as they never touched our gums and, therefore, didn’t increase the risk of sensitivity. The strips are on the more expensive side; however, we think they’re worth the price, considering you can use them as a one-time treatment and over time for brighter, whiter teeth.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $54.99</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Treatments: </strong>7 | <strong>Time: </strong>1 hour | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hydrogen peroxide</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person opens the Crest 3DWhitestrips 1-Hour Express package" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/9-7PtuKvkMJUL-qz7CXwA-Mg0NQ=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-teeth-whitening-strips-test-crest-3d-white-1-hour-express-jthompson-8982-d8252106410743fea858e952a1ad6f1e.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person removes the Crest 3DWhitestrips 1-Hour Express from the package" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XdhZaPH9si5udwUdURfdZYEfUiA=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-teeth-whitening-strips-test-crest-3d-white-1-hour-express-jthompson-9003-29e638013ca444768ff64511b36c689b.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-crest-3dwhitestrips-bright-dental-whitening-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Crest 3DWhitestrips Bright Dental Whitening Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Walmart Crest 3DWhitestrips Bright Dental Whitening Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6qeoxvCV0x8Y-Ayr83ngrRpFd1M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/crest-3dwhitestrips-bright-dental-whitening-kit-9394ed221f0b41f98a14dc9ec6f81675.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Convenience</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>These whitened our teeth up to four shades during the testing period.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The treatment time requirements are once per day for only 30 minutes.</p></li><li readability=0><p>While these slightly overlapped our gums, we never experienced sensitivity.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>These are a little more noticeable on the teeth compared to the Crest 3DWhitestrips 1-Hour Express.</p></li><li readability=0><p>We wish these had a mint flavor, which would make the taste experience more enjoyable.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for another Crest whitening strip product that is a little less expensive, we were also highly impressed by the Crest 3DWhitestrips Bright Dental Whitening Kit.

almost every whitening formula. However, they only noticed a few tingles here and there over the two-week testing period. Despite the more gentle formula, the strips were still able to lighten teeth eight shades (going from S24 to S16), thanks to the hydrogen peroxide-based formula.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Albeit a little expensive compared to some other options we tested, these whitening strips feature 22 treatments, making them still much cheaper than in-office treatments.

Although the strips touch the gums and aren’t the greatest fit, they were by far one of the best options for actually whitening teeth as they lightened our pearly whites from S24 to S10.

For fast-acting teeth whitening strips, consider the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Crest 3DWhitestrips 1-Hour Express</a>, which is formulated with 10% hydrogen peroxide to remove stains in a single one-hour session with results lasting up to six months.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With that said, Ang says don’t discount lower concentrations entirely, as higher concentrations come with a greater chance of tooth or gum sensitivity. So, if you have a more sensitive mouth or are concerned about sensitivity caused by teeth whitening, look for lower-concentration formulas (just know that these might take a little longer to reach full effect).

In most cases, whitening strips take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, twice daily, over one or two weeks. However, quicker solutions, such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Crest 3DWhitestrips 1-Hour Express</a>, provide a whitening effect in a single one-hour session. According to Michael Kosdon, DDS, a cosmetic dentist, the time frame doesn’t mean a formula is better or worse instead, it’s about choosing a product that fits into your preferred time frame for results.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the best teeth whitening strips, our PEOPLE Tested team researched dozens of options before narrowing it down to 16 top picks.

These teeth whitening strips are designed for single-use sessions and can whiten teeth effectively in just one hour, with results lasting for up to six months.

With that said, if your natural tooth color is slightly yellow and you want to make them brighter, Kosdon says whitening strips aren’t effective as they won’t whiten teeth beyond the color they grew in.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re unsure about whether or not whitening strips can transform your teeth color, Ang recommends consulting with a dentist to find out what kind of staining (if any) you might have and if white strips are the best solution.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.97674418604651><p><span class=accordion__title>What happens if you leave whitening strips on longer than 30 minutes?</span></p><p>Just like with other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>whitening products</a>, when whitening teeth at home with strips, always follow the recommended treatment time. “If whitening strips are left on the teeth longer than the recommended time, this can lead to potential side effects including gum irritation, tooth sensitivity, uneven whitening results, and even potential gastrointestinal upset due to ingesting the active ingredients,” says Ang. Additionally, overuse or extended use beyond what is recommended can damage the tooth's outer layer (aka the enamel).&nbsp;</p><p>If you experience any of these side effects or a negative reaction to whitening strips, Ang says it’s advised to discontinue use and discuss concerns with your dentist.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do I rinse after whitening strips?</span></p><p>Rinsing after whitening strips is recommended to remove any excess whitening gel on the teeth. “This could help prevent the excess gel from migrating to the gums and causing irritation,” Ang notes.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do I brush my teeth after whitening strips?</span></p><p>You can definitely brush your teeth after whitening strips to remove the residual whitening gel from the teeth. However, Ang says to keep in mind that active gels can cause damage to the tooth if brushing is aggressive or a hard-bristle toothbrush is used. “Use a soft or even extra-soft bristle toothbrush and be cognizant to gently brush all surfaces to prevent damage to the teeth and gums,” she explains. “Brushing gently and with a soft-bristle toothbrush will not interfere or affect whitening unless the manufacturer specifically instructs not to brush after the use of the strips.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jessie Quinn</a> is a contributing commerce writer for PEOPLE and has written for publications such as Byrdie, InStyle, The Spruce, NYLON, and more.

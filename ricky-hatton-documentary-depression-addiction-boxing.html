More importantly the second one, 12 November, previously it was on an internet PPV channel, with the cost of living now and spending, the situation that it is.</p><p>"I want all fight fans to see my exhibition, me and Marco, unless you could afford a ticket or afford the PPV, otherwise you wouldn't have f***king seen it.</p><p>"Now it's on Sky Sports, all fight fans will get to see it. Personally I think that was a massive thing, it's the first training camp I had in 10 years.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Boxing</h2></p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Contact the Samaritans</h3></p><p>If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, contact The Samaritans on 116 123.</p><p>They are available for free at anytime.</p><p>Or email <a href=#>https://www.samaritans.org/</a></p><p>"Now I've had two in 10 years. I've stayed on top of things, I had a bit of a wind-down. I do 10 rounds sparring, I wouldn't have been able to in the last time. Now I can."</p><p>Hatton also admitted he would fancy another crack at <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather</a>, having lost to the American in December 2007.</p><p>On whether he likes the prospect of an exhibition rematch, Hatton added: "I believe so, Floyd is doing a lot of them. I don't like to think I'd do it against a YouTuber, he's the greatest of all time.</p><p>"I hope it doesn't bite me on the a***, I think it won't. The whole point of these is it's somebody like Marco. It's for a lot of people who struggle with mental health, look what you can do.</p><p>"I'm sharing the ring with Marco. Not Joe Bloggs. Not to point the finger at YouTubers, if that's your job, that's your job. But what the f*** is Floyd doing?</p><p>"I'd look at it [if he called me], for the same reason as I've said. I've been in with Floyd, I thought, 'Jesus he was good', to do that again, to share the ring with arguably the greatest of all time, of course I would, I'd look at it. But this my first one."</p><p>Hatton also revealed his joy at still being around to help train son Campbell, as well as being able to be a granddad.</p><p>He continued: "I've been sparring with Campbell. Which has been brilliant. Very emotional for me. Without boring you, nearly took my life a few years ago.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"I was in such a bad place. If I had taken my life I wouldn't have seen Campbell turn pro, or seen my granddaughter, Campbell's daughter Lyla. I never thought I'd go into a training camp like Campbell, father and son.</p><p>"It's replaced lifting the world title fight, thousands of fans in Vegas. I've done some great things in boxing, but that's up there, it f***ing was, it was so emotional."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/7e4a3080-ce49-4e7d-a8bd-af0767832371.jpg><p><strong>If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans for free on&nbsp;116123.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zgpJpZ25vX6e2pLfYZp%2BarKSku26wzpyspp2eqa6zxYydnKmqlajAqrvNZpidnJmYwaq7zWaZqLCZo7Rw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

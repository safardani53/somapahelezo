Trying on the viral M&S leather leggings.”</p><p>She then said: “OK, I'm gonna try these on now. I've not tried them on yet, so these are my first impressions.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more fashion stories">Read more fashion stories</h2><p>“Material - I really like it. It's not too thick. It feels quite <span id=958b34f2-ede5-4098-a22a-1eb791695f30 class=suggested-link>nice</span>. The inside has got a bit of a lining, it’s quite soft.</p><p>“I went for a size 8 regular length. Usually in <a href=#>Zara</a> leather leggings I go for a medium or a 10.&nbsp;</p><p>“Sometimes I can get away with a small, but the last time I tried that, I was very quickly humbled and before I left the house I split them. So hopefully these fit okay.”</p><p>Moments later, Hayley modelled her new leggings, which she paired with a long-sleeved black crop top, as she explained: “They were actually really easy to get on. They have a lot of stretch to them actually.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“I was a bit worried at first but they went on really nice.</p><p>“These actually fit me perfectly. There is a little bit of room to move about and stuff, which is always good. I don't feel like I'm gonna split them.</p><p>“The only thing is the waistband did get a bit twisted when I was putting them on, but yeah, love them.</p><p>“I would say just stick with your normal size. I wouldn't size up because then I think there'd be too much material round the knees.</p><p>“I love these so much. I feel like you can wear them in so many different ways. They’d look nice with a plain black top like this, bodysuits, jumpers. You could layer these up over winter.</p><p>“I just think these are a really good find for £25.”&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=#>TikTok</a> clip, which was posted under the username @<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">hayleylaurajones</a>, has clearly impressed many, as it has quickly amassed 34,400 views.</p><p>Social media users were stunned at the leggings and one shopper even described them as the ‘nicest leggings around’.&nbsp;</p><p>One person said: “I have these in the navy, they are deffo the nicest leggings around and keep their shape so well.”</p><p>Another added: “You look great.”</p><p>If you fancy getting yourself a pair of these £25 trousers, they are available to buy online or instore now.</p><p>Not only do they come in black - but there’s six other colours too, including pewter, silver, brown, dark burgundy, navy and dark green.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re available in three different length options - short/petite, regular and long and sizes range from a 6 to a 22, so they are great for a range of <a href=#>body shapes</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>But they are are selling out fast - so if you want to look fabulous this <a href=#>winter</a>, you’ll need to move quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.

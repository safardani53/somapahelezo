He made me an offer I couldn’t refuse and I am not in a position to argue with the Gambino family. I am not a thug.</p><p>“So the whole thing fell on me. But the truth is I had nothing to do with stealing the sex tape and I didn’t make one cent from it.”</p><p>Rand apologised to <a href=#>Baywatch star Pammy</a> for his small role in the tape being distributed all over the world in 1996, but claims he was only a bit-part player in a much larger conspiracy.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>From his home in California, Rand added: “I’m genuinely sorry if Pam was traumatised by what ­happened. I know it caused her a great deal of upset because the footage was very personal.</p><p>“Do I feel guilty about my small part? Yes. I wish I had nothing to do with it. The sex tape has changed my life and it almost led to me being killed.”</p><p>Rand broke his long silence after his story was dramatised in Pam & Tommy, released earlier this month.</p><p>The eight-part drama, which stars <a href=#>Lily James</a> as Pammy, Sebastian Stan as Motley Crue drummer Tommy and Seth Rogan as electrician Rand, has led to complaints that it has retraumatised the Nineties pin-up.</p><p>Pam, now 54, was outraged when highly personal footage shot with her new husband became the first celebrity sex tape to go viral on the internet.</p><p>Friends say the mum of two has even refused to watch the trailer for Pam & Tommy.</p><p>Having divorced the rocker in 1998 after three years of marriage, she snubbed requests to advise 32-year-old Brit Lily on the role.</p><p>Rand was one of half a dozen workers carrying out a refurbishment of the couple’s three-storey LA mansion in 1995.</p><h2 id=she-was-beautiful>‘She was beautiful’</h2><p>He claims they were all sacked after weeks of toil and Tommy, who complained about “shoddy work”, refused to pay them, leaving Rand £15,000 out of pocket.</p><p>When he returned to the property to collect his tools, he claims Tommy pointed a gun at him.</p><p>Rand said: “I would see Pam occasionally when I was working on the house, and when she was around it was hard to concentrate.</p><p>“At noon she would always make a pitcher of Martinis for her and Tommy.</p><p>"One day she came down in a pair of Levi cut-offs and a T-shirt that, frankly, showed the lower half of her breasts. You couldn’t help but look.</p><p>“She was beautiful. Tommy would occasionally talk to me when he changed his mind about things. But we didn’t have one argument until he pointed the gun at me. Most of the Pam & Tommy series is total baloney.</p><p>“The real reason we were fired was that Tommy had bought a new Ferrari, a new speedboat and this expensive house and he ran out of money.</p><p>“We were told we were fired by the general contractor, and when I asked for my money, I was told I wasn’t getting it.</p><p>“I went back to get my tools and had to squeeze past the electric gates, which were a little rickety.</p><p>“Tommy must have heard and he came out with his gun. He said, ‘What are you doing — get off my property’. He had a gun, so what was I supposed to do?”</p><p>Rand revealed in 2014 that he sneaked into the mansion and made off with a Browning safe in revenge for the unpaid work. The tape was inside.</p><h2 id=pointed-gun-at-crotch>‘Pointed gun at crotch’</h2><p>But he now insists he has been forced to lie for years by the Gambino family — Italian-American mobsters involved in racketeering, extortion, drug trafficking, prostitution and pornography.</p><p>Rand claims his only role was handing the old-fashioned Hi8 tape to late adult movie studio boss Milton Ingley, who had the ­equipment to play it.</p><p>Rand, who knew Milton from a stint working as a male porn star, said: “One day, someone — and it was one person — came into our editing bay and handed the tape to me. I handed the tape to Milton and it went into the machine.</p><p>“My reaction was, ‘Oh my God’. A lot of things went through my head like, ‘How did they get hold of this?’.</p><p>“That person was not one of the crew who worked on the house, but I’ll never give them up because they are still alive and I gave them my word.”</p><p>Milton took a £30,000 loan from Gambino gangster Louis “Butchie” Peraino to cover the manufacturing and distribution costs of the video but could not find a company to sell the illegally acquired footage.</p><p>In the end he resorted to flogging it on the internet — and when people realised they could watch Pam and well-endowed Tommy having sex it went viral, making millions for Milton.</p><p>Rand said: “All I did was take the tapes and stuff them into boxes and help with the shipping.</p><p>“Milton did all the deals, Milton did everything. I never saw a cent.” Rand’s involvement made him the target of violent attacks.</p><p>He said: “One day eight bikers arrived at the porn studio and beat up a colleague that looked like me and pointed a shotgun at his crotch.</p><p>Another time two cars carrying four private eyes chased me down the street. None of them ever caught up with me. If they had, I’d be dead.”</p><p>Milton spent his later years hiding out in Amsterdam and died aged 60 in 2006.</p><p>Rand, who has never been arrested or charged, still works as an electrician. He refuses to watch the Pam & Tommy series.</p><p>Of the clips he has seen, he said: “I hate the way they try to make me look like an idiot.</p><p>"Seth Rogan playing me is like having Marty Feldman play Brad Pitt. I don’t find it flattering. I’m almost 64 and I’m in better shape than he is.</p><p>“I have made nothing from this, I was never consulted.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“It crossed my mind to sue as the series shows things that are not factual. But I am very much into spirituality and the quiet life.</p><p>“If I saw Pam and Tommy I would explain that what happened would have taken place whether I was involved or not.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000708990769-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000710600893-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000708098021-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000652057994.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000712741657-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSBeISPamxxZ5iWu6XFzJqlZqiRorKtrYyapZ2doqi8r3nTqKSmsV2hsqZ505qnnmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

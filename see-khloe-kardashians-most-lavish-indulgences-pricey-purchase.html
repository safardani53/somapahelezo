has been accused of flaunting her wealth, has spared no expense when outfitting herself and her family with the finest things that life has to offer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/khloe-kardashian-drowning-waist-baggy-838004667.jpg> <img

reality TV star's success has afforded her access to and the ability to purchase a $450,000 Rolls Royce and an exclusive Hermes bag, among other pricey items.</p><h2>LUXURY VEHICLES</h2><p>Last year, <a href=#>Khloe</a>, 39, added a bright blue <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lamborghini</a> Urus to her already sizable fleet of luxury vehicles.</p><p>The <a href=#>Good American</a> co-founder showed off her new wheels on an episode of her Hulu reality series, <a href=#>The Kardashians</a>.</p><p>Lamborghini’s Urus pushes the boundaries of traditional SUV form and function with its super-car-like performance that’s housed in a practical frame.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON KHLOE KARDASHIAN">READ MORE ON KHLOE KARDASHIAN</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lamborghini</a>&nbsp;describes its Urus’ performance, saying it's “powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 650 CV and 850 Nm of torque, Urus accelerates from 0 to 62 mph in 3.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 190 mph.”</p><p>The Urus gives you the speed you’d typically seek in a Lamborghini sports car while allowing you the opportunity to explore a wide range of terrains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/khloe-kardashian-707798383.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/rolls-royce-wraith-black-badge-749916870.jpg><p>The Urus, which Khloe's sisters <a href=#>Kylie</a>, 26, and <a href=#>Kendall</a>, 27 also own, costs around $218,000.</p><p>Soon after Khloe debuted her brand new Lamborghini SUV, the reality TV star picked up a Rolls-Royce Ghost Black Badge.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Khloe already owned both a Rolls-Royce Cullinan and a Rolls-Royce Phantom, according to <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Richest</a>.</p><p>The twin-turbocharged V12 Cullinan is priced at about $350,000 while the equally powered Rolls-Royce Wraith set the TV personality back about $450,000.</p><p>Khloe purchased the new ride after she and her on-again-off-again baby daddy, <a href=#>Tristan Thompson</a>, 32, welcomed their second child together, <a href=#>Tatum</a>, now one.</p><p>The Rolls-Royce Ghost Black Badge costs approximately $500,000 and has a 0 to 62 mph time of just 4.8 seconds.</p><h2>BIRKIN BAG</h2><p>Earlier this year, Khloe was photographed in distressed jeans with over <a href=#>$125,000 in purses draped over her arm</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> alum was spotted leaving a studio in Calabasas, <a href=#>California</a>, in photos exclusively obtained by The U.S. Sun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/khloe-kardashian-looks-glamorous-leaving-809320375.jpg><p>The apparel brand founder was wearing extremely ripped jeans with tears from the top of her thighs to just below her knees.</p><p>The light-wash denim jeans also had slits in the front of the pant leg to show off the <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> native's white sneakers.</p><p>The jeans appeared to be several sizes too big for the reality star as they were practically falling off her hips and her&nbsp;<a href=#>legs were nearly invisible</a>&nbsp;under the fabric.</p><p>On top, she maintained her extremely casual vibe with a simple white zip-up hoodie.</p><p>She wore her blond hair half up, and she accessorized the outfit with a large pair of black sunglasses.</p><p>To finish off the look, Khloe carried around two bags to remind everyone that her style is <a href=#>anything but casual</a>.</p><p>The first bag was the extremely popular&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Medium Dior Book Tote</a>&nbsp;from the French fashion house,&nbsp;<a href=#>Dior</a>.</p><p>The boxy tote bag with a unique jungle design sells for $3,350 on Dior's website.</p><p>The second bag Khloe was carrying was the real show stopper.</p><p>It was a matte alligator&nbsp;<a href=#>Birkin bag</a>&nbsp;with gold hardware in a pretty seafoam green color.</p><p>The same bag is currently listed on a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">resale website</a>&nbsp;for $125,000.</p><h2>PLAY-MANSION</h2><p>This month, Khloe <a href=#>showed off her over-the-top playhouse</a> for her daughter <a href=#>True</a>, five, as she gave a glimpse of the extravagant exterior of the play area on Snapchat.</p><p>The playhouse was set in the&nbsp;<a href=#>luxurious gardens</a>&nbsp;of Khloe's&nbsp;<a href=#>$17million Los Angeles mansion</a>.</p><p>The pretend home looked big enough to replace an actual small family home.</p><p>Unlike most playhouses made out of plastic or rustic wood, the exterior featured smooth wooden panels, metal details, and glass windows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/khloe-kardashians-reveals-true-thompsons-837169536-1.jpg><p>The area was surrounded by trees, which had been expertly groomed back from the entrance.</p><p>Approaching the playhouse, three sturdy&nbsp;steps&nbsp;led up to a path toward the front door.</p><p>The door had a metal knocker and handle, while a life-size mailbox sat at its side.</p><p>The kids' play den had two floors, with what looked like a balcony coming out from the top level.</p><p>Khloe's post showing off the luxury toy comes after the star was criticized for her "wasteful" parenting.</p><h2>FLASHING THE CASH</h2><p>For her daughter's fifth birthday, she gave True an Octonauts-themed bash.</p><p>The party&nbsp;included a two-tier birthday cake, decorated with blue icing and covered with detailed characters from the kids' series.</p><p>In a video, taken by Khloe's sister Kylie, an entire underwater display was captured, filled with clear and colored balloons mimicking jellyfish floating around.</p><p>There was also a massive balloon display, made to look like a&nbsp;pink&nbsp;octopus wrapped around a cabana beside the in-ground pool.</p><p>She then showed off a wall of personalized backpacks, which Khloe offered to the kids as favors.</p><p>Critics complained about&nbsp;<a href=#>the show of wealth</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Reddit,&nbsp;Instagram, and&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;less than 24 hours after the party had ended.</p><p>One person wrote: "Ooooh to be this rich and put on these types of birthdays for my kids."</p><p>Another commented: "Birthday parties must be so fun when you're rich."</p><p>A third sarcastically added: "I love watching rich people enjoy their lives!"</p><p>While someone else quipped: "Here’s a 'little peak' at my garish, wasteful party that my child won’t remember, filled with food that will never be eaten and crafts that will never get fully completed."</p><p>Although fans were concerned about the little ones and their broken arms, many were furious at Khloe for filtering the children for her own aesthetic purposes.</p><h2>GUCCI GOWN</h2><p>Around the same time as the birthday party, T<a href=#>rue posed in a $1,200 pink Gucci dress</a> for Easter.</p><p>The mom-of-two shared a variety of pictures of&nbsp;True&nbsp;on her Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/khloe-kardashian-posts-sweet-easter-808911251.jpg><p><a href=#>True</a>&nbsp;was all smiles in the photos while throwing her hands in the air and posing with peace signs.</p><p>She sported an all-pink ensemble including a bow headband on her head as well as the&nbsp;<a href=#>Gucci dress</a>.</p><p>As for jewelry,&nbsp;<a href=#>True</a>&nbsp;showed off a necklace with her name on it as well as a gold cross. She also wore two bracelets on her arms.</p><h2>CALABASAS ABODE</h2><p>Beyond True's playhouse, <a href=#>Khloe has boasted the beauty</a> that lies behind her $17million dollar mansion in Calabasas, California.</p><p>Khloe recently released a few snaps on Snapchat of her picturesque backyard that looked like it could be featured in Home & Gardens.</p><p>Photos included in the&nbsp;<a href=#>social media</a>&nbsp;thread flaunted her luxuriously large pool.</p><p>Surrounding her outdoor swimming area was several plush cream-colored lounge chairs.</p><p>Located near the pool was a splendid cabana filled with a flat-screen television and chairs that coordinated with the ones around the pool.</p><p>Near her pool was also a square concrete fire pit that had a set of chairs around it.</p><p>Towering trees flooded her backyard, and healthy green grass covered its perimeter.</p><p>The mom of two even had a toy ram and toy lamb situated on her patio for her kids,&nbsp;True and&nbsp;Tatum to play with.</p><p>Khloe actually shared two pics of True, one of her petting the fake ram, and another of her stroking the faux lamb.</p><p>The&nbsp;Hulu&nbsp;personality never seems to miss an opportunity to post about her home, especially the back of it.</p><p>The Kardashians&nbsp;star took to her Snapchat again last month to share pictures of her&nbsp;<a href=#>sprawling backyard</a>.</p><p>In them,&nbsp;Khloe captured a ton of fish swimming in a pond and an arch over a walkway into the yard.</p><p>She also gave an up-close view of her rose garden beside her massive in-ground swimming pool.</p><p>After a lengthy building process, Khloe moved into the&nbsp;<a href=#>home</a>&nbsp;in November 2021.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>It's directly next door to her mother,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kris Jenner's</a>, 67,&nbsp;<a href=#>$20million mansion</a>, in the exclusive gated community.</p><p>Khloe initially delayed her move into the home after plans for her ex-boyfriend Tristan to move with her changed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/khloe-kardashian-shows-off-look-837853230-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/khlos-space-khloe-kardashian-takes-819003968.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/khloe-kardashian-shows-off-curves-818038933.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwaGuAcYWVaKqenV2gta27xGaimqqUlsCptcCnqmaln6jBbrjAr6CsoF2eu6XBy6Ccp5uVqHqxvsicnLJloKq%2FpLTArJxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

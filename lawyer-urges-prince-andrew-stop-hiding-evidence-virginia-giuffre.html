Mr Seiger said: “I don’t understand his silence. His reputation is damaged beyond repair and if he thinks he can just stay in Windsor Castle hoping this will go away he is mistaken.”</p><p>He urged <a href=#>Prince Andrew to “do the right thing and co-operate” with US authorities</a> investigating Epstein and Maxwell, as well as provide evidence in Virginia’s case.</p><p>Mr Seiger said: “What Prince Andrew is doing is a mystery to me. I’m a very big believer in the rule of law. I have no idea of his innocence or guilt but he is ­certainly in a position to help the Epstein victims and investigators understand what happened.”</p><p>Two years ago the Dunn family joined forces with Epstein victims to put pressure on Sacoolas and the Duke of York to co-operate with law enforcement.</p><p>In February 2020, Mr Seiger held a press conference in New York with Ms Bloom, the lawyer representing six of Epstein’s victims.</p><p>She said the “parallels between the two cases are eerie” and involved everyday teenagers who were victimised.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Sacoolas, 42, is accused of killing 19-year-old Harry when his motorbike crashed into a car said to have been driving on the wrong side of the road outside a US military base in Northamptonshire in August 2019. Later this month Sacoolas is expected to take part in a hearing at Westminster magistrates’ court via video link after authorities on both sides of the Atlantic agreed a deal.</p><p>Mr Seiger said Andrew should consider doing the same in the Giuffre case.</p><p>He said it was only by working together that justice could be done.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000702053212.webp> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Bombshell ‘evidence' from witness who claims he saw Prince Andrew groping Virginia Roberts to appear in new documentary</span><p><strong>GOT a story?

He finished the race well enough a length off the pace and should have learned plenty from the experience. This 6f trip seemed to suit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/racing-haydock-154956jpg-js337352026.jpg><p><strong>2.00</strong></p><p>Most of these are very hit and miss but at least <strong>VALLARTA</strong> managed to win over course and distance last time out 14 days ago. He has been raised 3lb for that, which shouldn’t be a major problem. He was in front for a long way and did well to keep going on similar ground.</p><p><strong>2.30</strong></p><p><strong>JABBAROCKIE</strong> is in the form of his life and matched his recent exploits with a convincing front-running win at Haydock last time out. He wasn’t stopping at the line so a 6lb penalty won’t be a problem. He is turned out quickly but has gone well doing that before.</p><h3><a href=# rel>CLASS APART<span> James Doyle produces a masterclass to win the Irish Oaks on Sea Of Class</span></a></h3><p><strong>3.05</strong></p><p><strong>NAPLES BAY</strong> got no luck in running here last time when repeatedly blocked when trying to challenge. His winning chance had gone by the time he got some racing room and this extra furlong should help from what looks a fair mark.</p><p><strong>3.35</strong></p><p><strong>MISCHIEF MANAGED</strong> continues to run well and returned to the AW for a good second at Wolverhampton last time after hitting the frame at Carlisle. He won over this distance on his last trip to Ayr in May and is a fair 5lb higher in the weights now. That was a similar contest and he should be right there again.</p><p><strong>4.10</strong></p><p><strong>COVIGLIA</strong> likes it here with a win and second from two runs. He continues to hold his form as he creeps up the weights and was beaten just a neck at Chester last time. That was in a stronger race than this and he finished strongly, making this hike in distance a wise move.</p><p><strong>4.40</strong></p><p><strong>GLASSES UP</strong> has won on both his starts over course and distance and had a fair bit left on his handicap debut earlier this month. He’s gone up 4lb for that but it would be a surprise if he wasn’t capable of improvement past that in conditions that are ideal.</p><p><strong>5.10</strong></p><p><strong>GLENBANK KING</strong> was beaten less than two lengths coming back from a 10-month break here last time out. Taking his rider’s claim into account, he is 4lb lower than when winning over course and distance last season. He handles quick ground but won’t mind if the forecast rain comes.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest in Horse Racing</h2></p><p><strong>CARTMEL</strong></p><p>2.15 Lucca Lady</p><p>2.45 Camillas Wish</p><p>3.20 Handy Hollow</p><p>3.50 Dear Sire</p><p>4.25 Wisty</p><p>4.55 Jovial Joey</p><p>5.25 Lord Fendale</p><p><strong>BEVERLEY</strong></p><p>6.00 General Zoff</p><p>6.30 Queen Jo Jo</p><p>7.00 Musharrif</p><p>7.30 Bit Of A Quirke</p><p>8.00 Equitant</p><p>8.30 Vigee Le Brun</p><p>9.00 John Caesar</p><p><strong>WINDSOR</strong></p><p>5.40 Tripartite</p><p>6.10 Happy Odyssey</p><p>6.40 Hackney Road</p><p>7.10 Open Wide</p><p>7.40 Life On Earth</p><p>8.10 Moving Forward</p><p>8.40 Whitehall</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Charlie Fellowes has his sights set on Cup glory with Prince Of Arran</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cIKXbG5ybWRkwbCwwLKqZp6imrJutM6rqp5lopawqrrGZquiqKNigHF7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The 19-year-old escaped to Panama from Miami after he was charged with a DUI on Jan. 23 — and he brought his new gal pal, <strong>Chantel Jeffries</strong>, along for the ride!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><a data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link href=#>Despite all the drama</a>, Justin is having fun in the sun. While he was spotted riding an ATV on the beach and shooting a video, it was his outfit that had us doing a double-take! His insanely baggy, bizarre leather shorts looked as if they were 10 sizes too big — in fact, I’m shocked he was able to keep them up! Aside from the fact that they were downright odd, they also definitely aren’t best suited for the beach. Justin, why not throw on a bathing suit?</p><p><span>Justin Takes Sexy Model On Vacation</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>He rocked the shorts with a tank top, sneakers, and a backwards hat. His tank was long on the star, staying consistent with his oversized style. Sure, Justin has his own signature look, but we think next time he hits the beach he should opt for a look that’s a little more appropriate! Unfortunately, his bizarre leather shorts just aren’t cutting it in our book, and we think it’s time he retires the look, for good.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Chantel, on the other hand, was certainly ready to hit the sand in style, rocking a tiny bikini bottom and a crop top as she looked on and watched Justin in action.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>What do you think?

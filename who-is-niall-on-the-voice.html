Let's learn everything about him!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Niall on 'The Voice'?</h2><p>Back in 2010, Irish singer-songwriter Niall Horan got his own big break on another reality singing show — <a href=#>The X Factor</a>.</p><p>Niall auditioned as a solo act, but then he and four other lads (who had each auditioned as solo acts too) were put together as a group called One Direction.</p><p>Niall was actually the first solo competitor on The X Factor chosen to be in One Direction, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>.</p><p>Naturally, One Direction made it, and Niall found himself in a new role as a global singing sensation until the band broke up in 2016.</p><p>So did Niall release any solo albums or go on tour (or act in films with ridiculous amounts of <a href=#>behind-the-scenes drama</a> like his former bandmate <a href=#>Harry Styles</a>)? No to the latter, but yes to the former.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Niall has released three solo albums (so far).</h2><p>Niall didn't waste any time following One Direction's conscious uncoupling in 2016, signing as a solo artist with Capitol Records and releasing his first two solo albums, "Flicker" and "Heartbreak Weather" in 2017 and 2020 respectively.</p><p>The Voice Season 23 judge is still signed to Capitol Records, and announced on his social media channels that he'll be releasing his third solo album, "The Show," on June 9, 2023.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He's already released his first single from the album, a song titled "Heaven."</p><p>Fans can even pre-order "The Show" on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Niall's official website</a> now (but there's a limit of four copies per customer, just FYI!).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@niallhoran href=#>@niallhoran</a><p>I couldn’t possibly be more happy to tell you that my new album ‘The Show’ will be released on June 9th.

Beyond that, it's unknown if the couple have any plans to tie the knot (maybe after The Voice Season 23 wraps up?).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The future looks bright for Niall.

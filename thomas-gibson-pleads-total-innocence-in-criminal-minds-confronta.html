I had hoped to see it through to the end, but that won’t be possible now.</p><p>"I would just like to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing crew, and, most importantly, the best fans that a show could ever hope to have.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/thomas-gibson-in-a-tux-681x1024.jpg><p>Pretty basic.</p><p>Now, however, Gibson has opened up to People Magazine about what actually went down between him and Williams.</p><p>"We were shooting a scene late one night when I went to Virgil and told him there was a line that I thought contradicted an earlier line," <a href=#>explains Gibson</a>.</p><p>"He said, ‘Sorry, it’s necessary, and I absolutely have to have it.’"</p><p>Irritated, Gibson goes on to say he was sharing his frustration with some co-workers when Williams entered the room.</p><p>"He came into that room and started coming towards me. As he brushed past me, my foot came up and tapped him on the leg," Gibson says.</p><p>"If I hadn’t moved, he would have run into me. We had some choice words, for which I apologized the next day, and that was it. It was over. We shot the scene, I went home – and I never got to go back."</p><p>Look, we weren’t there.</p><p>We obviously don’t know what transpired.</p><p>But Gibson is claiming his "foot came up and tapped" Williams? That sounds like someone desperately trying to downplay an incident.</p><p>Looking ahead, Gibson will appear on the first two episodes of Criminal Minds Season 12 (filmed prior to this confrontation) and then be written out of the series.</p><p>"It seems like they’re trying to erase me from the show. That hurts. But I’m using this time to be with my kids, and I look forward to what’s next," says the father of three.</p><p>"Maybe I’ll do a comedy, or a play, or direct, or produce."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/thomas-gibson-as-hotchner-1024x640.jpg><p>Gibson concludes that his “pride and reputation are hurt,” for sure. But he’s looking for further opportunities to “do good work and be a good guy."</p><p>"I feel like it took years to make a good reputation and a minute to damage it," he laments.</p><p><strong>You can <a href=#>watch Criminal Minds online</a> or on television when Season 12 kicks off on CBS at 10/9c on September 28.</strong></p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2puX2WGcMDHqKSaq12ctqO%2FzqdkqaSVlrG0edOoq5qkXZ67r7vCnqWcnV2eu26v0aKkoqaRoXqutc2dqmabn6Ozs7vNrZho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

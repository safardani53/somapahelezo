It’s a complicated time to be making television now because, you know, some people couldn’t fly internationally, some people were on other TV or film shoots, some people are in bubbles on stuff,” he explained. “I think during a pandemic, it’s really hard to get everybody where you want to be. And the other thing, of course, is we have no flexibility. It was one night that those six (main cast members) were available.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Spotted-Paul-Rudd-Filmed-Friends-Finale-With-His-Camcorder-0003.jpg><p>Rudd’s character married Phoebe (<a href=#><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></a>) during season 10 of the show.

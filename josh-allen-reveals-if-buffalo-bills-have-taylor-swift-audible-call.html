Smith</strong>,’” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a>. (Smith is a retired basketball player.)</p><p>“It’s like … similar to that dress, right? Was it white and gold or blue and black?” Allen told the outlet, drawing comparison to the viral <a href=#>black-and-blue or white-and-gold dress debate</a> from 2015. “I’m not saying we don’t have a Taylor Swift call, but in the instance of that clip, I was saying J.R. Smith.” He added that the Bills “might call” Swift’s name as an audible “at some point during a game later” in the season.</p><p>Since Swift, 33, became linked to Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a> in September, the <a href=#>NFL has extensively covered</a> the “Shake It Off” singer. Allen told People that he thinks that the media attention is “obviously good for the brand.”</p><p>“I think it’s attracted a lot of viewers to what we’re doing, and I guess in this business, you’re either growing or you’re dying,” he said.</p><p>He went on to add that he tries “not to pay too much attention” to all of the media surrounding Swift. While Allen “understands” the strategy “from a business point of view,” he’s dedicated to “being the best quarterback that I can be.”</p><p>Allen himself has had his private life displayed in public. The NFL star sparked romance rumors with <a href=#><strong>Hailee Steinfeld</strong></a> in May when they were <a href=#>spotted together in New York City</a>, and was later photographed kissing the <a href=#>Pitch Perfect 2</a> actress in July.</p><p>“The fact that anybody cares about that still blows my mind,” he said while on the “Pardon My Take” podcast in August.</p><p>A source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in July that Steinfeld, 26, is “not putting any pressure or unrealistic expectations on things,” since Allen had <a href=#>recently called it quits</a> with ex <strong>Brittany Williams</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Josh is the first guy in a while she’s been really interested in,” the insider told Us at the time.</p><p>Steinfeld has since been spotted <a href=#>cheering on her new beau</a> from the stands in London earlier this month, and has even <a href=#>bought Bills merchandise</a> with Allen’s mom. The pair also recently took their date night to the rink when they attended the <a href=#>NHL’s Buffalo Sabres game</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGoq5hirq24xKdkq52mmq6tv4yinWaapZuzorjOZpmipJyoeqmt1Z5krZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXZbCpbXBpZxmm5GhuXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

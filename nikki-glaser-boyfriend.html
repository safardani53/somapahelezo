The two first met when Nikki co-hosted the MTV late night talk series, Nikki & Sara Live, in 2013. Chris worked on the series as a producer.</p><p>The pair continued to work together while they pursued a romantic relationship. After Nikki & Sara Live came to an end after two seasons, Chris produced Nikki's 2016 Comedy Central series, Not Safe with Nikki Glaser. The show was canceled after one season, and Nikki and Chris broke up shortly thereafter.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I always said when we got the show that it was going to be cancelled one day. Everyone used to say, 'You're so negative,' but I'm not pretending that I just made it. It might be pessimistic or not a great way to look at things always, but I was prepared to lose it at some point, just like I was prepared to lose my boyfriend," Nikki shared in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffalo News </a>in November of 2016. "Most relationships don't last, and most TV shows don't last. It softens the brunt when those things blow up."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Nikki's personal relationship with Chris didn't work out the first time, but they were back on by the time cameras started rolling for Welcome Home Nikki Glaser?.</p><p>Like Nikki, Chris decided to move back to St. Louis (which is also his hometown) during the pandemic.</p><p>On the second episode of the E! series, which aired on May 2, Nikki and Chris acknowledged that they were more than friends, but that they were not dating exclusively.

In the reality show’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">season finale</a>, Nikki wanted more commitment from her beau after years of being on and off.</p><p>“I want so badly to be able to say, 'Let's just f--king do it and get married,” Nikki says on the show. “We've been doing this off and on for eight years. Like, what are we doing?'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Nikki then added that if Chris couldn’t provide the stability she needed, she would leave St. Louis and return to LA. In addition to the move being a better fit for her comedy career, she didn’t want to risk seeing Chris looking for his next online hookup.</p><p>"If he can't do that, I’m not gonna stay in St. Louis,” Nikki declared. “I don't want to have to see his charming, gorgeous face pop up on my Bumble as a 'top pick' for me. Like, you're right, Bumble, he was. But he didn't want what I wanted!"</p><p>Although Nikki was willing to part ways with Chris, he proved he wasn’t ready to let her go. In another scene, Chris got down on one knee while they were outside. However, he didn’t ask her the big question. Instead, Chris asked Nikki to be his emergency contact, which, in COVID-19 times, is a pretty important deal. Nikki seemingly agreed as she celebrated the milestone in her confessional.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“Hey, you gotta start somewhere!"

Then Cole, whose relationship with <a href=#>Zanab</a> failed, asked Alexa's stepmom why she looked the same age as her stepdaughter. The answer has fans intrigued.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>First, it's worth noting that Alexa's dad, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Alfia,</a> got his own following after appearing on the <a href=#>Netflix</a> show and grilling Brennon with questions, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even testing Brennon</a>'s loyalty to his daughter. Adam claimed that Brennon must fully commit to Judaism, as his family is Israeli, before pulling out a set of knives — implying Brennon needed to be circumcised. Alexa commented, "I had no idea that that had happened. My dad is very funny."</p><p>Adam has a total of six children — five with his first wife, whose name has been kept from the public, and one with his second and much younger wife Morgan. He had Alexa when he was 24, and would split up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her biological mother</a> when she was still young.</p><p>But what is the age difference between Alexa and Morgan?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, how old is 'Love Is Blind' star Alexa's stepmom?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/ivNUGsAJp/0x0/alexa-stepmom-love-is-blind-1676127845732.jpg><p>When Cole asked Morgan why she looked the same age as her stepdaughter, who was celebrating a birthday, she replied, "Because we basically are." She's not wrong, Alexa is 27 and Morgan is 33, a difference of six years. That means that Morgan was born when Adam was 18. She is a 33-year-old woman wed to a 51-year-old man — though they did get married when he was 43, and she was 25. In any case, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexa's stepmom</a> has a great relationship with her family.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Morgan Alfia?</h2><p>Morgan married Adam in 2015. She used to work as an insurance agent with Allstate, but now she co-runs a gym and fitness center called NeonCycle+Strength with her husband. The two met ten years ago, but have both lived in North Texas most of their lives. She struggled with body-image issues while pregnant with her daughter, which is what led her to start up the fitness center with Adam. Besides the gym, she also earns money promoting products via social media, and has a $700,000 net worth.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Meanwhile, as Morgan has struggled with body image, Alexa battled body shamers throughout her time on the show. “The thing that I dislike the most is that people say, ‘Brennon loves me, in spite of my body.’ That sucks. Like what? No, he loves me and my body,” she said during the Betches Diet Starts Tomorrow podcast, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TV Insider</u></a>.</p><p>Now, the couple is moving on and looking forward to starting a family together, hopefully shushing all of the haters once and for all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoby3sYyiqmaanJ67pXnApZyxmV2owaa8zKik</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

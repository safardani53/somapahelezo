The challenge is taking advantage of those whose New Year's resolutions include a re-dedication to daily reading.</p><p>From Jan. 1 to Jan. 31, eligible Kindle owners can unlock diamond badges based on the amount of reading that they do and how much they engage with their apps.</p><p>There are Bronze, Silver, and Gold Reader badges. Those who read seven days in the month will receive the Bronze Badge, while Silver is worth 15 days. Gold is limited to those who are able to read for 30 days out of the month.</p><p>Other incentives include the "Goal Setter," which is achieved simply when the user sets a reading objective. The "I'm a Fan" target is completed when the user follows an author on the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another badge is "Book-in-Hand," and participants can get it by buying a Kindle ebook.&nbsp;</p><p>The "Start a Series" reward is earned when the reader begins a book that is part of a set, while "Quitters Day" encourages people to continue reading on Jan. 19, which is when most people decide to stop their New Year's resolutions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The final two badges are "Finisher" (when a full book is concluded) and "Overachiever," which can only be given when all of the other badge prerequisites have been completed.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what these badges translate into, there is a sweet reward.&nbsp;</p><p>If a participant earns at least four badges, Amazon Kindle gives them a $5 ebook credit that can be used toward any title. This credit expires 30 days after the challenge concludes.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Only those who received an email are eligible for the Amazon Kindle Challenge.</h2><p>While the description of the challenge has been enticing even those who are non-readers, sometimes, things are too good to be true.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no way to enter the challenge on your own accord; qualified Amazon Kindle owners were contacted via an email from the company to participate.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The contest is invite-only, so many interested users will not be able to take part. However, it is worthwhile to check your Kindle app to see if the offer is there. Some readers have noted that their email from Amazon wasn't easily accessible, and they learned of their eligibility from the app itself.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Though a select few will receive badges from Amazon that translate into monetary incentives, there's still every motivation to up your reading game.

That’s what his very own son, <strong>Marquise Jackson</strong>, 21, claimed in the comments section of a birthday tribute for sister <strong>Mia Jaè</strong> on May 23. Instead of offering birthday wishes,&nbsp;Blue Mountain State&nbsp;star <strong>Page Kennedy</strong>, 42, commented, “Yo tell yo pops to pay me my money son.” But instead of defending 50, his son replied, “Sh!t he owe me some money too 🤷🏾‍♂️😂.” Perhaps not the answer Page was expecting, the actor replied, “Oh.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>This is a new turn in the saga of 50 demanding people to pay him back, but it’s hardly surprising. The 43-year-old rapper and his son have blasted one another on social media in the past. Marquise even <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>slammed his father</a> after the rapper shaded his ex, <strong>Shaniqua Tompkins</strong> (Marquise’s mother) in Oct. 2018. Shaniqua was gearing up to do a reality television show, and 50 posted mean-spirited jokes like “you starting to look a little thirsty you ok?” and “Child support ls over😟.” Defending his mother, Marquise wrote on Instagram, “And y’all wonder why I don’t respect him as a man or father? You had a good run but it’s over big fella lol it’s been a decade. You’re 40+ you can grow up any day now.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The father-son feud continued into Nov. 2018, when 50 shockingly wrote that if his son and&nbsp;<strong>Kyle McGriff</strong> (the son of 50’s rival, <strong>Kenneth “Supreme” McGriff</strong>) “got hit by a bus,” he “wouldn’t have a bad day.” After leaving the comment under a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of Marquise and Kyle, the rapper attempted to do damage control by pointing out his child support receipts. “I have zero ill will towards anyone living on this Earth. The people Shanquois [sic] son looks up to and associates with is a reflection of the negative energy he embraces towards me,” 50 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>. “I paid his mother $1,360,000 in support to afford him opportunities I never had.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx0nHpglmnr/</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/50-cent-feuding-with-son-marquise-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>50 has had multiple bones to pick as of late, because he tried to collect alleged debts for the “Bank of Fofty” from&nbsp;Power&nbsp;executive producer <strong>Randall Emmett</strong> and BET star <strong>Jackie Long</strong>. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The&nbsp;Power&nbsp;star</a> has dissed even more celebrities in 2019: <strong>Ray J</strong>, <strong>Nick Cannon</strong>, <strong>Lala Kent</strong>, <strong>Teairra Marí</strong>, <strong>Kanye West</strong>, <strong>Lord Jamar</strong> and <strong>Common</strong>. If 50 ever decides to release a diss track, he’d have a lot of material to work with.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH12e5FsZm5oXZiyr8CMrKanZZ2Wv7LByKycZqKRmLi0u81mm5qcXaTEpr%2BMpqannalisLC5zJ6lrWWWmsKlew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

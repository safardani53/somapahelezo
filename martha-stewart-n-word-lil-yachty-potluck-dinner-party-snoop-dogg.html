On what was supposed to be an exciting day of album promotions,&nbsp;<strong>Lil Yachty</strong>, 19, got a major shock when&nbsp;<strong>Martha Stewart</strong>, 75, actually asked him his thoughts on the “n-word.” Long story short, Martha used the words “n–ga shit” to Yachty and <strong>Snoop Dogg</strong>, 45, cursed out the production team. And, a reporter for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Fader</a> witnessed it all go down. Here’s what happened…</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The reporter was following Yachty around for a cover story the site was doing on his new album, Teenage Emotions. And, when Yachty showed up to&nbsp;Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party to promote his album,&nbsp;the network [VH1] hadn’t gotten his album cover approved yet. That minor setback halted filming, which caused Snoop to cuss out the crew. Snoop did “a very loud, swear-filled finger wag,” and referred to Yachty’s album as “this n–ga’s sh-t.” While Snoop was flipping, that’s when Martha decided to confront Yachty about Snoop’s comments. “Yachty, does it upset you when Snoop says ‘n–ga sh-t?’”, she asked the rapper. Well, jaws dropped after that one.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“The room filled with every imaginable reaction: anger, horror, embarrassment, laughter, joy, pain,” the reporter wrote, adding that Martha seemed to not understand the consequences of her actions. However, the most surprising reaction of all? — Yachty’s. The rapper put on a large smile and continued the show in good spirits! Snoop’s reaction, on the other hand, has not been revealed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Comedian<strong>, Gary Owen</strong>, and actress <strong>Laverne Cox</strong>, were both on set that day, serving as co-hosts. However, their reactions were not mentioned.&nbsp;Luckily, The Fader&nbsp;said that the expletive did not make it on air. VH1 and Martha have not commented on the situaiton.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Although some have said that Martha’s intentions were not ill-willed, others thought she should have known better. Check out some of the fan reactions, below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>You of all people know better <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@MarthaStewart</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/f1uwoPRRHC</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>— bri (@bigshitxtalker) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 7, 2017</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/Damiilolaa/status/883364023667892225</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/ignitemydreams/status/883406070542151680</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think of Martha’s statement was an innocent mistake?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH14e49wZqaZoqm1onnSrZywmaKpeq951qipnWWcnrluxcCcn62xXaW8tbjUnKJmnJmju6a%2BjKmYq6ypYsCvu86pZJ2nl5x8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

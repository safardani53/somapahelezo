Aside from being brooding, charming, and fiercely blunt (in a cool, sexy <a href=#>Edward Cullen</a> kind of way), he's also a lying, cheating, calculating brute. Where could he possibly get his arrogant attitude and delinquency from?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Well, it's in Episode 5 —&nbsp;titled "Merry F--king Christmas" —&nbsp;that we meet Stephen's single mother, Norah, whom he visits during Baird College's holiday break. As we watch narcissistic Norah implement manipulation tactics of her own, it almost immediately becomes clear why he is the way that he is. The revealing episode was actor Jackson White's favorite to film, and there's a good reason for it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Katey Sagal plays Stephen's mother, Norah, in Hulu's 'Tell Me Lies.'</h2><p>Whether she's pouring scalding liquid on her hand for attention from Stephen or manipulating him into helping her stalk her ex-husband, Norah's vile behavior and personality traits give us insight into Stephen's history.

In Episode 5, "Merry F*cking Christmas," audiences instantly get the sense that Stephen's mother must be handled with kid gloves, and all of her children are constantly walking on eggshells so as not to disturb her. Of course, it doesn't work — she's determined to be the victim of every situation she finds herself in.</p><p>Neither the show nor the original novel provides an official diagnosis for Stephen's mom, but the book does establish that she has had some struggles with her mental health. In fact, in the book, version of Stephen's mom has been absent from his life since he was a teenager.

A slew of fan-favorite celebrity candidates will appear on the program. Kym Marsh, a 46-year-old actress, television presenter, and singer, is one of the show’s candidates, competing in the next competition ‘for the grandmothers out there.’</p><p>According to the show’s official synopsis:</p><p>“As the Bafta Award-winning program returns to BBC One, Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman will walk the red carpet for the class of 2019. The star-studded line-up will then make their way to the Strictly ballroom for the first time, eager to learn which professional dancer they’ll be matched with on their quest for the coveted Glitter Ball trophy.”</p><h2>Strictly Come Dancing’s Kym Marsh became a grandma for the second time in 2019.</h2><p>Kimberley Gail Ratcliff went solo after two UK number one songs and a UK number one album.&nbsp;Furthermore, in 2003, she released the album Standing Tall, which reached at number nine in the UK an yielded two UK top 10 singles. She played Michelle Connor in the ITV serial opera Coronation Street from 2006 until 2019. She also received the British Soap Award for Best Newcomer at the 2007 British Soap Awards.&nbsp;Nonetheless, Marsh will co-host the BBC One morning lifestyle show Morning Live in October 2020.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kym-Marsh-1.jpg alt="Kym Marsh" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Strictly Come Dancing participant has four children and just became a grandma for the second time. Kym wants to compete in the next dancing reality program to redefine what it means to be a grandma. No grandma, according to her, has ever won the glitterball prize.&nbsp;Dr. Xand van Tulleken told Kym on BBC Morning Live:</p><p>‘I think a grandma has never won Strictly before, so you may be a trailblazer!’</p><p>She responded with:</p><p>“I’m doing it for the sake of the grandparents out there.”</p><p>When it was confirmed that she will be appearing in the future season, she also said on her morning show:</p><p>“For years, I pondered doing Strictly, but the dates never worked out. I’m overjoyed that they have this year!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kym-Marsh-2.jpg alt="Kym Marsh" width=480 height=480 sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She went on:</p><p>“I’m a great fan of the program and can’t believe I’m going from watching in my jammies at home to dancing in front of the judges in a sparkly outfit, it’s unbelievable!”</p><p>Marsh also said that her parents were hidden behind the curtain when she went to perform her audition for the show and that they were even more delighted to watch her take to the dancing. Despite this, the actress is eager to master the new dancing forms, which will be a dramatic contrast to her pop world.&nbsp;Strictly Come Dancing will launch on BBC One on September 23 at 7:00 p.m. ET.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Kym Marsh</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Strictly Come Dancing</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBut9imZKaZoqi1brLRqKRmq6SntqTAy7JknKedmnqlrc2coKefXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

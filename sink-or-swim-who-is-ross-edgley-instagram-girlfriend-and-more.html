I was heavy and durable and I was SO incredibly proud of that body since it’s the one that swam 1,780 miles around GB🇬🇧 Today I’m 90kg. I’m lighter, leaner and faster and equally proud I’m running (and swimming) my fastest 10km 💪🏽 My point (again) is: Make your body an instrument NOT an ornament and celebrate any form of “athletic aesthetic” that comes from doing what you love 😊 From the GIANT quads of rugby players to the broad shoulders of swimmers 🔱 With that said, what’s your favourite body part from your sport?</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Ross Edgley</a> (@rossedgley) on Aug 11, 2019 at 3:51am PDT</p></figure>View Instagram Post<p>WATCH SINK OR SWIM FOR STAND UP TO CANCER TUESDAYS AT 9.30 PM ON CHANNEL 4</p><p><strong>SUBSCRIBE AND READ THE NEW REALITY TITBIT MAGAZINE&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a></strong></p><p><a href=#>Sink or Swim: What happened to Sair Khan’s mum?</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdno567rHnOq2Ssr5mieri0zmagrGWipMC0ecSdnqWdqWK2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1itKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqiusNmpKiqlQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

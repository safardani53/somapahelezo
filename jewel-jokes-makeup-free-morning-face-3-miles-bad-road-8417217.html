I did not have one little teeny drop of alcohol, nothing. And I look like three miles of bad road. Why?" she said, laughing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My face always goes on strike in Las Vegas," she continued. "I don't know. I walk through the casinos and my eyes burn."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Must be all the sin there," she quipped.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jewel went on to explain that the situation was only worsened by the fact that she forgot to bring one of her skincare essentials with her on her trip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You know what I do for a living? Travel. Do you think I'd be good at packing? Well, I suck," she admitted. "Somehow in my whole bag of toiletries, I don't even have facial cleanser. I'm 49 years old. How do I not pack cleanser?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The musician's followers were quick to reassure her that she looks beautiful, dry desert air or not. "You can never look bad, youâ€™re beautiful. I think sometimes we just wake up looking tired from everything that we are dealing with as humans," one person wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another commented with a little advice, "Itâ€™s because thereâ€™s no humidity thereðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°. Drink some water."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As her video continued, Jewel switched topics and revealed her big plans for the night ahead: a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>U2</a> concert at Sphere. "I'm really excited," she said about seeing the Irish rock band.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also shared that the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) was happening in town at the same time â€” and seeing all of the western-clad attendees was making her nostalgic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Y'all, I'm staying at this hotel, and there are so many cowboys. I love seeing it. It's a sea of cowboy hats. It's like the ghost of Christmas past. I spent decades of my life at the NFR," she explained. "It's a trip to be here. It brings back so many memories. Great memories. Love seeing all the country folk out here."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story â€” sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jewel.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Weiss Eubanks/NBCUniversal via Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in September, Jewel reflected on her successful, decades-long career in the music industry, telling PEOPLE that she felt a lot of pressure to turn out another hit album after her 1995 debut effort Pieces of You.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"After my first album was so successful, I felt a lot of pressure to follow it up and I went, 'Wait a minute. I just won the lotto. I sold more albums than anybody had ever sold practically on a debut album,' " she explained. "And so if I saved my money, I actually had no pressure. I didn't have to. There was no 'have to' about anything."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ultimately, she made a decision to let go of the pressure and expectations, giving her a sense of freedom when it came to making music.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I made a decision, I think really young â€” by 20, 21 â€” to just say, 'I get to do whatever I want, whenever I want, however I want. I'm never going to succumb to the pressure of...' " she continued. "And so whether people like musical genres I did or didn't do, it was me. It was just me wanting to do whatever I wanted to do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's a mindset she still embraces today. "I still feel that way.

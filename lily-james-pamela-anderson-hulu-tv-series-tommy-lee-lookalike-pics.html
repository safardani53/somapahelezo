The young actress will be joined by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sebastian Stan</strong></a>, 38, who will play opposite her in the role of Tommy in the eight-episode feature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lily-James-Casted-As-Pamerla-Anderson-Tommy-Lee-Hulu-Series-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The highly-anticipated series will tell the story of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pamela and Tommy’s</a> headline-making time together, in the 1990s, including the leak of their private honeymoon video after their whirlwind <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>marriage</a> (they married after just a few days of dating) and the legal battle that followed, the outlet further reported. As one of the biggest sex symbols of the ’90s era, Pamela made quite an impression with her stint on Baywatch and her many appearances in Playboy, and it’s great to know Lily is ready to take on the challenge!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sebastian-Stan-Cast-Tommy-Lee-Pamela-Anderson-Series-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The English star is best known for her long-term role in the period drama series Downton Abbey from 2012-2015, and she also played the title role in the 2015 film Cinderella. Although some may find it hard to see how Lily could portray Pamela, her incredible talent and similar features to the blonde bombshell, which can be seen above, make her an excellent choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lily-James-Casted-As-Pamela-Anderson-Tommy-Lee-Hulu-Series-AP-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sebastian also seems to be a great choice for the role of Tommy. The Romanian-American actor has already made a name for himself in the television industry with roles like Carter Baizen in&nbsp;<i>Gossip Girl </i>from 2007-2010, and T.J. Hammond in 2012’s <i>Political Animals</i>, which earned him a Critics’ Choice Television Award nomination. He also appears to have similar features to the <strong>Motley Crue</strong> drummer, which could work perfectly for the series.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In addition to Lily and Sebastian, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Seth</strong> <strong>Rogan</strong></a>, 38, who is producing the series along with <strong>Evan Goldberg</strong> and <strong>Dylan Sellers</strong>, has also reportedly been cast as the man who stole Pamela & Tommy’s honeymoon tape. <strong>Craig Gillespie</strong>, who directed the hit movie, I, Tonya, is also reportedly involved in the series. Pamela and Tommy, who share son <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brandon</strong></a>, 24, are not involved but are reportedly aware of the production.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5BuZqWhnK56q63MnqpmqJGisq2tjJqlnZ2iqLyveceuo65lpKt6tLHRopysZaSkuq7FjKWcnmWcpLysrcuiop5loJ6wtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The Tom Cruise vehicle is likely one of the year’s most critically and economically successful films, and its launch on streaming platforms is anticipated to increase its appeal.</p><p>Fans who were unable to see Top Gun: Maverick in time for its theatrical debut may now watch it on Paramount+. Aside from Tom Cruise, the picture stars Val Kilmer, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman, and Ed Harris. Subscribers to Paramount+, even those on the ad-supported version, will be able to watch the movie for free.&nbsp;In addition, new channel customers may utilize their 7-day trial period on their Paramount+ subscription to watch Top Gun: Maverick for free.</p><p></p><h2>Top Gun: Maverick – Synopsis, audience reaction, and more investigated</h2><p>Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the cult classic Top Gun, in which Tom Cruise again appeared. Paramount Pictures first announced the project in 2010.&nbsp;Years after the events of the previous film, it follows Tom Crusie’s Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell. He is a test pilot and flying instructor who prepares Top Gun grads for a particular assignment.</p><p>According to the film’s synopsis:</p><p>“Pete “Maverick” Mitchell is where he belongs after more than 30 years of duty as one of the Navy’s best aviators, pushing the edge as a brave test pilot and avoiding the rise in rank that would halt him. Maverick must face the demons of his past and his worst fears while training a detachment of graduates for a particular assignment, culminating in a mission that requires the ultimate sacrifice from those who choose to fly it.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Top-Gun-Maverick-1.jpg alt="Top Gun Maverick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Top Gun: Maverick was a popular film in theaters.</h2><p>Since its premiere on May 27, 2022, the Joseph Kosinski-directed film has gained worldwide appreciation from fans and has grossed more than $1.488 billion at the box office. This might explain why the film took so long to become available on streaming services.&nbsp;Of course, there was an earlier digital release, and the film was accessible for renting/buying on sites like Amazon Prime Video, but today the film will finally be available for mobile streaming. When asked about the film’s theater experience, Paramount CFO Naveen Chopra stated:</p><p>“Certain films are designed specifically for the theater experience. Top Gun is an excellent illustration of this,… You should view the movie in a cinema, where it will be available for a longer length of time.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Top-Gun-Maverick-2.jpg alt="Top Gun Maverick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Top Gun: Maverick will be streamed for free via Paramount+, a subscription-based program. The streaming network’s monthly membership starts at $5 per month for ad-supported access and goes up to $10 per month for ad-free access.&nbsp;Alternatively, fans may watch the film for free with a 7-day trial of Paramount+, if they have not previously used this option. The trial is only available once per user.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdnMKvecyarZ6qmZi4brXSZqqerF2pvG6%2BxKWcmquVmXqwuoypmKuZnaTCr8CMqaOuq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

this is because chiropody was given a new name in 1993.</p><p>Chiropodists and podiatrists have the same qualifications and experience.</p><p>And both can help you with minor or more severe foot issues.</p><p>They are not doctors though.</p><p>Richard Rawlins, a consultant orthopedic surgeon, said that podiatrists should not be able to call themselves surgeons.</p><p>Mr Rawlins, a member of the British Medical Association's Central Consultants Specialist Committee, said: "If they are asked by patients are they doctors then they have to say no.</p><p>"And yet they are allowed to call themselves surgeons, which most patients will take as having been to medical school and having undergone the same rigorous medical training as heart surgeons and others.</p><p>"It creates the wrong impression and it can mislead patients."<br>Podiatrists say though to become registered podiatrists have to complete a full time three or four year degree in the subject at one of 13 schools of podiatry across Britain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004266237021.jpg><p>Another seven years of training is needed to become a podiatric surgeon, including years of on-the-job experience and an additional masters and certificate in surgery.</p><p>They insist that the term does not confuse patients.</p><p>Mike O'Neill, a consultant podiatric surgeon and a spokesman for the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists, said: "Nobody ever raises this issue about, say, dental surgeons.</p><p>"We know that there are different types of surgeons within the NHS and patients accept that.</p><p>"None of my patients has ever thought that I am a doctor.</p><p>"Frankly, a lot of this just comes down to jealousy.</p><p>"Orthopedic surgeons were not that interested in feet 10 or 15 years ago, and just wanted to concentrate on hips and knees.</p><p>"But now they have seen the good work we do and are jealous that patients continue to come to us."<br></p><h2>How much does a visit cost?</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS</a> recommends contacting your GP to see if you qualify for treatment on the NHS.</p><p>On April 1, 2013, clinical commissioning groups (CCGs)&nbsp;were given the power to decide what footcare services to&nbsp;commission for their local area.</p><p>Guidelines from NICE recommends that footcare services that relate to diabetes, peripheral arterial disease and rheumatoid arthritis should be available on the NHS.</p><p>But there's no NICE guidance for foot health provision that isn't associated with a long-term condition.</p><p>This means that each&nbsp;individual CCG will decide what to make available on the NHS, depending on local need.</p><p>If your condition isn't affecting your health or mobility,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;a verruca that looks ugly but doesn't hurt when you walk,&nbsp;you're unlikely to be&nbsp;eligible for NHS podiatry.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST POPULAR IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>Contact your GP to see&nbsp;if you qualify for NHS podiatry treatment.</p><p>However, if free care isn't available, you can pay to visit a clinic for a private appointment.</p><p>The cost of this can vary depending on the problem, but many first consultations are priced between £30-60 depending on location and clinic.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>French tennis player Kristina Mladenovic wins this year’s sweaty feet contest</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5ZpaGpsYmp8uLTArWScoJmnvLG7w6KqrWWgpLGqrdOroKysXaKyorrIp55mnJmbs6a%2BxKeanmWTpMC1ec%2BroJydXZuypsCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe -

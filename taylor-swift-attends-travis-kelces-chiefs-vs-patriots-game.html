Swift brought along dad<strong> Scott Swift</strong>, backup singer <strong>Melanie Nyema</strong>, stylist <strong>Ashley Avignone</strong> and musician<strong> Alana Haim</strong>.</p><p class=p1>Before Kelce, 34, and the Kansas City Chiefs met the New England Patriots at their Gillette Stadium in Boston, he arrived in a <i>Reputation</i>-coded outfit. Kelce was <a href=# rel=noopener>photographed</a> wearing a black jacket, matching slacks and oversized sunglasses as he arrived at the venue. Similar dark colors have notably represented Swift’s LP <i>Reputation </i>since it was released in 2017.</p><p class=p1>Ahead of last week’s Sunday Night Football game, Kelce sported<a href=#> a very <i>Evermore</i>-inspired outfit</a> of a flannel jacket and a green beanie. Swift, for her part, <a href=#>seemingly took a style cue from <i>Reputation</i> </a>with her leather miniskirt and vintage black-and-red Chiefs sweatshirt. (Many Swifties speculated that the pop star was tweaking her style in advance of her rerecorded version of <i>Reputation</i>, which Swift has not announced yet.)</p><p class=p1>Swift and Kelce have been linked since earlier this summer — after he failed to meet her backstage at her <i>Eras Tour </i>in July. Swift brought <a href=#>her latest concert tour</a> to Kansas City in July for two sold-out shows, and Kelce watched from a private suite. Despite making a friendship bracelet for Swift with his phone number, <a href=#>they didn’t cross paths</a> and he detailed the story on his “New Heights” podcast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-attends-travis-kelces-chiefs-vs-patriots-game-promo-01.jpg><p class=p1>“[Our relationship] all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” the 12-time Grammy winner <a href=#>told <i>TIME</i> in her Person of the Year profile</a>, which was released earlier this month. “We actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.”</p><p class=p1>After a few months of keeping their romance private, Swift attended her first Chiefs game in September. Clad in team gear, Swift watched Kelce and the Chiefs score a victory against the Chicago Bears from a private suite with her boyfriend’s mom, <strong>Donna</strong>. Swift has since attended five more of Kelce’s games.</p><p class=p1>“When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” she further told <i>TIME</i>. “We’re just proud of each other.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>After Swift watched Kelce and the Chiefs lose to the Buffalo Bills on December 10, she returned home to New York City<a href=#> for a blowout birthday bash</a> with friends including <strong>Jack Antonoff</strong>, <strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong>, <strong>Miles Teller</strong>, <strong>Blake Lively</strong> and <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong>. Kelce was unable to make the celebration due to his NFL practice schedule.</p><p class=p3><span class=s1>Despite Kelce’s absence, he didn’t let the special day go unnoticed. A source exclusively told <i>Us </i>earlier this month that the pro athlete <a href=#>wanted to “throw the best party possible”</a> and that “money is no object.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdlsG1sc2dqmasopbDqr%2BMpJylm5WoeqS0yJ6drGWmqHqxrdOroKiso2K0ornEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

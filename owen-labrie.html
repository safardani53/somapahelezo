Owen attended the New Hampshire prep school, graduating in 2014. That year, he allegedly took part of a “Senior Salute,” an alleged school tradition where graduating seniors proposition younger classmates for sexual favors. Owen was accused of raping a freshman girl, <strong>Chessy Prout</strong>,&nbsp;in May 2014. In Aug. 2015, Owen’s case went to trial. Owen said that he stopped short of having sex with the young girl, but many of his school friends testified that he told them that they did indeed have sex. After eight hours of deliberation, the jury acquitted him of felony rape, the most serious of the charges. The jury did not believe his claim that he didn’t have sex with her. Instead, they found that the state did not prove the girl did not consent to what happened between them. Owen was convicted of three counts of misdemeanor sexual assault, one count of endangering the welfare of a child and a felony count of using a computer to lure a minor. The last charge will require him to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. However, Owen was only sentenced to a year in prison, and then only served two months of the sentence.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Owen Labrie is known as the St. Paul Prep Student who was accused of raping a girl in a “Senior Salute” hazing.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Owen was a top student and won a full scholarship to Harvard.

During an interview with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Photoculture</a>, he revealed that he chose to print photos using nineteenth-century techniques due to its rarity. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The photographer also maintained that he&nbsp;first became interested in the art after realizing that it would be near impossible to procure good printing materials in the future. This was around 2005 when the digital era hadn't caught up just yet.

The rapper was sitting behind the driver’s seat of his black BMW when two armed suspects approached him, with one opening fire. XXX took a bullet to the neck, a shot that would prove fatal. The Broward County Sheriff’s department arrested a suspect in the shooting on June 20, a 22-year-old named&nbsp;<strong>Dedrick D. Williams</strong>. The suspect was booked on charges of first-degree murder, as well as a probation violation for a prior grand theft auto charge.

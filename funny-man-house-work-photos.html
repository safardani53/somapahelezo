But Redditor <a rel=nofollow href=#>dirty-ol-sob</a> recently mistook his wife's appreciation for helping around the house as a kink. He decided to be a little seductive and send his wife some sexy photos as he did odd chores around the house.&nbsp;</p><p>Which gave birth to these masterpieces...&nbsp;</p><p>He titled his post, "My wife really likes it when I do housework so I sent her these pictures while she was at work hoping it would turn her on" and shared hilarious photos of himself doing laundry.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirty-ol-sob</a> posted the photos to Reddit, where they attracted quite a bit of attention and people in the comments section shared that they were blown away by his dedication to making these mundane chores as sensual as possible.</p><p>A lot of effort went into these.&nbsp;</p><p>"Just knowing that you went through the effort of taking the last picture on a timer makes me wonder how long you held those other poses for," he explained.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>Others joked that he should tone down a bit, but it was unclear whether or not it was for his sake or that they didn't feel like getting hot and bothered themselves.

Another added, "I love it, last time I was stuck at home and she was working I cleaned everything, the floors, flipped the mattresses, the bathroom, even made dinner. Sat down to play a game 30 minutes before she came home. Door opens and the first words out of her mouth were 'So you've been playing freaking games all day again huh'. I just laughed and said yea what's the problem, she was pissed and went into the kitchen and realized dinner was almost ready. Went to the bathroom and came out and said you're a [jerk], why didn't you tell me you cleaned up? I just smiled and said you don't tell me when you clean up, but I do appreciate it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>What a great idea.&nbsp;Maybe the next time you want to get your partner in the mood, try out some "chore play" like our Dirty Slob friend here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYW18cX2ObGdokmWlf4WZjp%2Bsp6apYrqiuoyhpq6rlWLEsL7KZqehp6SkwA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Parents and Family Inspires Her Roles</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>If you have watched the American television soap opera <a href=# rel=follow>The Bold and the Beautiful</a>, you must be familiar with actress Kiara Barnes. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The talented actress — who was born to her American parents in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States — had been portraying the role of Zoe Buckingham in the long-running soap since 2018 before she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quit the show</a> earlier this year.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"It's been a pleasure having Kiara in the role of Zoe Buckingham on The Bold and the Beautiful. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors," the head writer and executive producer, Bradley Bell, said about the actress' exit. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, during her appearance in the soap opera, she impressed the audience with her portrayal of a troubled model, introduced as a rather unhinged British character.</p><p></p><p><strong>Kiara Barnes with her The Bold and the Beautiful family.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She initially stalked her ex-boyfriend, Xander Avant [played by Adain Bradley], and had a British accent.</p><p>But as the show progressed and she became more of a mainstream character, she lost her accent while playing a prominent part.</p><h2>Fans Think Kiara Barnes Is British</h2><p>As stated earlier, Barnes was born in the United States to American parents, making her American by birth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In addition, her family reportedly are of African and Irish origin, while she belongs to the Christian faith.</p><p>But since she had a British accent while playing her breakthrough role, many fans thought that she belonged to English roots — and was British by birth.</p><p>And that is not true. The truth is — Barnes gave auditions for the soap when the production put out a casting call for an English actress to play a new role of Zoe. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Soaps In Depth</a>, the actress didn't want to let a little thing like the country of her birth get in the way to bag a role in a successful soap. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I gave them my British accent and they were really into it," she told the tabloid of her B&B audition. "They said, 'Wow! We really felt that voice,' which is great because I knew then that I had a convincing accent."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Similarly, she also impressed her co-star Bradley, along with the showrunners, who reportedly was stunned to hear her real voice a week after working with her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Kiara Barnes' Parents and Grandmother Helped Her with British Accent</h2><p>In another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with News24</a> in September 2020, when she was asked the secret behind her convincing British accent, Barnes stated her grandmother was Irish, and she helped her with her accent.</p><p>"I don't know if it was just because I loved acting from a very young age and have always played around with accents. My grandmother's Irish as well," she stated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Besides, the actress also <a href=# rel="follow noopener">spoke with TV Insider</a> and credited her parents and grandparents for inspiring her role of Ruby Akuda in the television series Fantasy Island. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She said that her "loving, compassionate" character felt a lot like her parents; hence, she took inspiration from them to play Ruby. "And so I definitely pull from my Nana, and my mother, even women on set," she added. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Besides&nbsp;The Bold and the Beautiful and&nbsp;Fantasy Island,&nbsp;Barnes' acting credits include 2020's television movie&nbsp;The Wrong Wedding Planner and 2020's TV series Stuck with You.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOZlr%2BiecGaqaedo2K9or7Ep6usZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

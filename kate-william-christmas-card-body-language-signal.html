expert claim</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>The Prince and Princess of Wales's 2023 Christmas card has been released and a body language expert has spotted a “powerful signal” they are displaying.</p><p>The Wales’s appear in a black and white photograph, which is a far cry away from previous years' <span id=aadff505-4718-4f2a-ac4c-c5e5173a7792 class=suggested-link>Christmas</span> card offerings.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

are seemingly all wearing white shirts and dark jeans, looking relaxed and smiling at the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Body language expert Judi James analysed the image and gave her thoughts exclusively to The Sun.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The styling&nbsp;</h2><p>Judi first noted how the "monochrome photo might not suggest a typical Christmas look".</p><p>But there "is a very powerful signal that the <span id=77641d41-ffc9-4991-9e78-9389350dd71b class=suggested-link>Prince</span> and Princess of <span id=c4ce6b15-a778-4995-bc8f-3aeb84d24534 class=suggested-link>Wales</span>, and their three children" are "announcing".</p><p>And that is "the fact that they are a very cool and a very unbreachable family unit".</p><p>“The strong sense of tight, loving ‘uniformed’ grouping and the stark monochrome, plus the relaxed and confident body language looks like the emotional equivalent of them having a moat and drawbridge around them.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ROYAL">READ MORE ROYAL</h2><p>Judi continued: “We’re being shown the strength and total confidence of the pared-down family brand here, without all the trimmings and trappings of their royal status.&nbsp;</p><p>“We know they look superb in formalwear and royal regalia but this is the casual and much more relatable version and if anything it proves they’ve got the charisma with or without the diamonds and medals.</p><p>They are a very cool and a very unbreachable family unit</p><span class=quote-credit>Judi James</span><p>“The casual jeans and white shirts look effortlessly cool on all of them and the simple ‘uniform’ signals teamwork and group resilience.</p><p>“Within the ‘brand’ though their body language defines them as five individual personalities,” she noted.&nbsp;</p><p>“Each one of them wears a different smile and their poses hint at a slow but seismic movement in the <span id=37a668a2-01a2-43bd-86db-707000e51392 class=suggested-link>power</span> balance, just like any other close and loving family when the children start to grow up.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Charlotte 'placed and looking like the late Queen'&nbsp;</h2><p>Judi noted <a href=# aria-label="Princess Charlotte (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Charlotte</a>’s position within the photo and commented: “Previous Christmas cards have shown poses that have been built around <span id=1cb18cdc-e5ef-4344-a028-fbd0675e50ed class=suggested-link>William</span>.&nbsp;</p><p>“Here though it seems to have been built around Charlotte.&nbsp;</p><p>“Sitting in the middle of the pose while the others stand she looks confident, relaxed and elegant.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you took the others out of the pose she would still make a congruent photo.”&nbsp;</p><p>Judi noted "her gleaming eye-smile and symmetric mouth smile" which could suggest "authentic happiness".</p><p>She added: "But there is also a subtler and more poignant factor about the way the group have gathered around the daughter on a chair.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read ROYAL STORIES</h2></p><p>“Charlotte looks so much like the late Queen and this central status-rich pose and beautiful smile are like echoes of Elizabeth when she was young.&nbsp;</p><p>“This effect doesn’t look deliberate but it is still a rather moving message from this family Christmas card.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'Proud' William and 'grinning' Louis&nbsp;</h2><p>The expert spotted “<a aria-label="Prince William (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince William</a>’s head-tilt" which "suggests a desire to be liked".</p><p>She added: "His smile and his pose have the look of a proud dad who is happily beginning to be pushed to the back row as his three more independent children take to the front.&nbsp;</p><p>“He still has a hand on <a href=# aria-label="Prince Louis (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Louis</a>’s shoulder but his youngest son’s grin here suggests he will be needing less and less protection from his dad as time goes on.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kate&nbsp;with a 'perfect' smile</h2><p>Judi looked at the <a href=# aria-label="Princess of Wales (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess of <span id=67c0b975-4243-4b07-bbb6-d6e24dae510e class=suggested-link>Wales</span></a> in the image and noted: “Kate leans into William’s torso to make this a subtly romantic pose too though.&nbsp;</p><p>“Her perfect, Duchenne smile looks more confident than William’s and with her husband on one side and son George leaning in on her torso on the other, the sense of unity and loving continuity looks strong.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>George&nbsp;showing his 'own identity'</h2><p>As for the <span id=8077a48a-9775-46bf-befc-680c3dfd9bc1 class=suggested-link>future</span> heir, Judi said: “<a href=# aria-label="Prince George (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince George</a>’s pose makes him look at his most relaxed and grown-up to date.&nbsp;</p><p>“He is smiling but he’s not following the group norm with a teeth-baring smile.</p><p>“This is one of the first poses where he has begun to look like very much his own young man with his own identity rather than William’s mini-me."</p><p>Judi opined: "George’s best smiles have been photographed by his mother and he has tended to look a little uncomfortable in formal poses.</p><p>"But here he has one hand slung casually in his pocket and his smile is shown in his eye expression, with a soft, closed-lip mouth smile,” she concluded.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ

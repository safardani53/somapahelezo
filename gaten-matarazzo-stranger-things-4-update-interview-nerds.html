As we all eagerly await to see the next season of the smash <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Netflix</a> show, Gaten, who plays Dustin Henderson, is currently still filming episodes, a process that he admits, like most things, has been affected by the pandemic.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Slow,” Gaten says, when asked how production is coming along on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 4</a>. “Slowly, but surely. [Filming] already is basically playing it by ear anyway, but the pandemic on top of it just makes scheduling a lot harder.” Still, the show is going on as best it can, and if nothing else, it means Gaten has been able to reunite with his co-stars, many of which he had not seen or been in touch with for months.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gaten-Matarazzo-netflix-embed-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Everyone’s great,” Gaten says, “I actually had not gotten to see anybody really during the quarantine at all. There was a stretch of 6 months where we really weren’t talking to each other a lot; we all had stuff going on at home. But that made going back a lot more fun.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>The minute we stepped back on set, we said, ‘We have the coolest job on planet earth.'”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Aside from wrapping up the season in the coming year, Gaten is also working on a fun new project with NERDS candy. As part of the brand’s debut of their latest multi-texture invention – Gummy Clusters –&nbsp; Gaten is inviting fans to interact with him on social media to be true nerds and come up with crazy hypotheses about the first-of-its-kind new candy. “<span class=s1>Making the videos has been a lot of fun,” says Gaten, “And I like that they have fans participate in it as well. Fans can go to my Instagram and tell us how they think Gummy Clusters came to exist — because I’m still trying to figure it out and I need people’s help!”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>So far, Gaten’s seen theories ranging from wizards in the clouds to mad scientists to a theory about ‘unicorn turds’, but at the end of the day, the experience is a chance to connect with fans and get a little, well, nerdy! “My nerdy friends and I stick together, and I love that we now have a new candy to enjoy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>So, with all this talk of nerds and the word becoming synonymous with Stranger Things since season 2, it begs the question — who is the biggest nerd in the Stranger Things cast? “<span class=s1>Probably me,” he confesses. “Out of the kids, for sure me. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Finn Wolfhard</strong></a>’s up there too.” But then, reminded of a recent game of Dungeons & Dragons that he filmed with some of the cast at the end of last year, he adds one more name to the list. “</span><span class=s1><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>David Harbour</strong></a>’s kind of a nerd. David’s the one who pitched the D&D idea, and I was all in… He doesn’t seem that way upfront, but you get to know him.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye5BtZqCZpJq7brnArZirmaqvvG6%2F06uYp5%2BVp3q1tMinnqxlZGLCsbDArZxmoZ6psrPCyJ6uZqaVp7G0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

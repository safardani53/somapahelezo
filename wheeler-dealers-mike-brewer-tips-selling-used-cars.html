They want to promote their business through their vehicle.</p><p>“So we set about slightly modifying the vans to give them that sort of urban look. And from there, it’s just taken off, we’ve sort of found this niche in the market.”</p><p>Setting your vehicle away from the crowd can help attract attention and so, hopefully, buyers.</p><p>By providing something a little different from the ordinary, Brewer said he had customers travelling from all over the country to buy his vehicles.</p><p>He advised trying to find a niche although that isn’t always so easy.</p><p>Brewer said: “You have to know what works in your area and you won’t know what works until you try it.</p><p>“So you have to throw down an eclectic mix of vehicles and find out which ones are working. And if you’re selling five <a href=#>Fiestas</a> a week, but one <a href=#>Corsa</a>, then buy Fiestas as that’s where your market is.</p><p>“The new business has been phenomenal, I’m not gonna lie. We run a tight ship. We’ve got very good social media and it looks great online.”</p><p>Brewer also took the time to reflect on marking 20 years of the TV show which occurred last year.</p><p>He said: “We celebrated 20 years of Wheeler Dealers in 2023 – it’s a little show that I started to make in 2003 in October with its first airing.</p><p>“Now, 20 years later, we’re still going and we’re still making new series.&nbsp;</p><p>“Throughout the year, we’ve had many a celebration, no matter where I’ve been on the planet, whether it was in America or <a href=#>Germany</a> or <a href=#>Poland</a> or in the UK, we’ve had many celebrations.</p><p>“Just recognising what an achievement it is and what an impact it’s had on the motoring landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>“The show has sparked a whole new genre of car restoration programmes and now there are networks dedicated to just that. They can all work their way back to this little show called Wheeler Dealers.”</p><p>In November though, Mike revealed how his TV job "nearly <a href=#>cost him his marriage</a>".</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Last month, he told what the <a href=#>five worst things</a> you could say to a car dealer.</p><p>Mike also explained recently what all the <a href=#>car dealer jargon</a> really means.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1979-fiesta-went-missing-overnight-858357242.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgZFqbm1sYGTEqbHEpZyrZZSarq2x0axkpqGbmnqjvsSwnKtlpJ69tHnSnqOloZ6cera%2FxJ1knJmiqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

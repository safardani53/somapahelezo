Happy Saturday!</p><p>However, many of the <a href=#>TLC</a> star's <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers took note of how flawless and young Meri's face looked in the photo.</p><p>One person commented: "You are positively glowing Meri, whatever you're doing keep doing it."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Another went a step further, and suggested that surgical enhancements were behind Meri's appearance.</p><p>They asked: "Loving the glow up.

Instead, let life live through you. Do not worry that your life is turning upside down.

We didn't consult, we didn't talk, she just made the decision.'</p><p>"And then he says: 'No, I don't consider myself married to Meri.' Like, he just made the decision.

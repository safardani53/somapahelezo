like most forms of the disease, can be fatal if not treated and detected early.</p><p>If the illness has not spread outside the stomach, the five-year survival rate is 70 percent, according to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>.</p><p>However, if the disease has spread to surrounding tissues or organs, the five-year survival rate drops to 32 percent.</p><p>The early signs of stomach cancer are hard to catch because there are rarely symptoms.</p><p>However, according to the ACS, some signs to look out for are weight loss without trying, feeling full after only eating a small amount of food, swelling or fluid build-up in the abdomen, loss of appetite, nausea, and heartburn.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title

The live show, which took place at <a href=#>Dodger Stadium</a>, housed more than 50,000 fans and included several celebrity guests like <a href=#>Dua Lipa</a>, Kiki Dee, and <a href=#>Brandi Carlile</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>OK, we know you may be experiencing extreme FOMO; however, there's no need to because the three-hour concert is available to stream on <a href=#>Disney Plus</a>!

While the iconic vocalist wrote the music, Bernie penned the lyrics to the October 1970 hit. Regarding the song's lyrics and overall message, many (including Elton John himself) find the verses to be cryptic and virtually incomprehensible.</p><p>In 2005, the then 58-year-old Elton <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke about the song and said</a>, "in the early days, there were a lot of inquiries about 'What does this song mean? What does that song mean?' and in the case of 'Take me to the pilot/Lead me through the chamber/Take me to the pilot/I am but a stranger,' I have no idea! You're on your own, I tell you."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>OK, we give Elton a pass since he didn't write the lyrics, but what about Bernie? Does he have any insight regarding the meaning of "Take Me to the Pilot"? Unfortunately, the lyricist is just as clueless as the singer. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AlbumLinerNotes.com</a>, Bernie admitted he had "no idea" what the song was about.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I used to hear about David Bowie throwing words into a hat, picking them out, and putting them together," Bernie said. "The great revolutionary poets did that; I’m sure Baudelaire and Rimbaud were so stoned out of their minds, they just threw things together and went 'Wow! That sounds good.'"</p><p>Bernie concluded, "It’s how they sound together, you don’t have to worry about whether it rhymes or whether the meter’s great. It’s just how it feels here and now. The perfect example of that is 'Take Me To The Pilot.' If anybody can tell me what that song’s about, it’d be great. But hey, it worked."</p><p>Although the lyrical meaning is seemingly non-existent, we can all agree that "Take Me to the Pilot" remains one of Elton John's greatest songs — it's a wild showstopper that we could play for hours on end without getting sick of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa6ssYymnGasn2LBqbGMqaClp6RiwLC6xmaknpmenruo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

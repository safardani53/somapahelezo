She described their dynamic as “an interesting situation” before detailing the status of their bond today.</p><p>“He just challenged me to be in a fantasy football league and I was like, ‘OK, great. I’m gonna invite you in a league. We’re gonna play fantasy football,’” she said. “Because you’re, like, hitting me up by DM, talking smack about fantasy football, like, ‘I’ll help you sell your team.’ Like, dude, I do this for a living.”</p><p>Lisa Ann continued, “The day before the draft, he goes radio silent. I don’t hear from him for a month. Then a month later, it’s like, ‘Oh, some things came up.’ I was like, ‘You know what? We’re done. You inconvenienced me.’”</p><p>Earlier in the episode, the actress, who portrayed <a href=#><strong>Sarah Palin</strong></a> in a 2008 adult film, reflected upon a statement she previously made, equating sex with her to being with “an Olympian athlete.” When asked if Kardashian measured up, she simply said: “No, not an Olympian.”</p><p></p><p>She told <a href=#>TMZ</a> in 2009 that she was seeing Kardashian <a href=#>after meeting at an L.A. gym</a>. During that period, <a href=#>she said the Rob & Chyna alum</a> “treats me like his little teacher and we have a fun sexual relationship that is simple and carefree.” She also said Kardashian “brings out the total cougar in me and I just like to teach him things.”</p><p>A source close to Kardashian told Us Weekly at the time that <a href=#>Lisa Ann’s claims were “not true.”</a> The insider confirmed that the pair met at a gym but had “never even hooked up.”</p><p>It’s not the first time the radio personality has spoken about her interactions with the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star. She&nbsp;opened up to <a href=#>VladTV</a> in 2015, explaining, “Years ago, Rob Kardashian and I hung out a bit and when he was asked [about us], he told me he couldn’t admit it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Well, we can’t hang out anymore’ and he’s like, ‘What do you mean?’” she continued. “I’m like, ‘Your sister [<a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>] did a porn and that’s why she’s popular. How can you not want to talk to me? What the f–k is wrong with you?’”</p><p>At the time, she said they had “started talking again about six months ago.” Lisa Ann noted that <a href=#>she’s “always checking in on” Rob</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloaOWeqK6zWarmqSbqHqqutOeqZ6rpJ67qHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlksKGknXqzwcyoqZ6cXZrFbr7Om2SkmaKZrrS0yJqlaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

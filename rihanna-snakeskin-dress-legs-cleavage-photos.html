Following her recent trip to Dubai, RiRi headed Down Under, where she launched her Fenty Beauty Brand at an exclusive party in Sydney, Australia on Oct. 2. For the event, Rihanna put her toned legs on display by wearing a very short silver dress, which featured a snakeskin pattern. The strapless ensemble also allowed her to reveal some major cleavage, and she struck fierce poses to show off the look. Oh, and yes — she paired it with a matching snakeskin bucket hat, purse and heels. Yep, she did THAT!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Over the last week, Rihanna has been slaying in outfit after outfit, as she’s been bringing her Fenty Beauty collection around the globe.

People born in the year of the snake are idealists. They may appear frigid on the outside, but on the inside, they are warm and eager. Their yearning for sole possession is intense.

Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Grammy Award-winning recording artist who specializes in love ballads like “When a Man Loves a Woman” and “How Am I Supposed to Live Without You.” He married Maureen McGuire on May 4, 1975 and they divorced in 1990.

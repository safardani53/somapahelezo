It’s only been a week and I’ve had two such dreams. Two.</p><p>The thing is that while we sort of understand how Allison Mack slid up the ranks to allegedly become the second- or third-in-command of DOS, we’ve never really had a clear picture of how she got started in it.</p><p>As it turns out, she was recruited … by Smallville costar Kristin Kreuk.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>Allison Mack is reportedly either the second or third in command of a master-slave sex cult called DOS.</p><p>According to an alarming expose by The New York Times, DOS is a cult that operates within NXIVM</p><p>NXIVM is a "self-help" organization that features programs that allegedly promote female empowerment … in exchange for a large chunk of money. Oh, and recruiting new members.</p><p>Based upon descriptions and reports, one might think of NXIVM like what would happen if the Church of Scientology had a baby with a more run-of-the-mill pyramid scheme.</p><p>At some point, certain women start going on starvation diets (seriously — no reputable doctor would recommend this) and taking only cold showers … and submitting incriminating photos that could later be used against them as blackmail.</p><p>And then these women are required to submit to branding, having Keith Raniere’s initials branded into their pubic region. They are "slaves," each serving a "master,’ all the way to the top.</p><p>Brainwashing and corporal punishment are reportedly standard fare for these members of DOS.</p><p>And while Raniere is at the head of this alleged cult, Allison Mack is said to be right below him. Having undergone brainwashing herself, Mack is described as "both a perpetrator and a victim" of the cult’s abuse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/kristin-kreuk-749x1024.jpg><p>But how did she get started with all of this?</p><p>That’s where Kristin Kreuk comes in.</p><p>Kreuk&nbsp;is best known for her work on Smallville, playing Clark Kent’s adolescent romantic interest, Lana Lang. She was eventually written out of the series in a particularly goofy way.</p><p>Kristin Kreuk also starred on Beauty and the Beast, the 2012 series, which … was not a great show and finally came to an end in 2016.</p><p>And it’s now reported that she was the one who first recruited Allison Mack to NXIVM.</p><p>A woman named Susan Dones told HollywoodLife about <a href=#>Kristin Kreuk’s&nbsp;involvement with the cult</a>.</p><p>"Yes Kristin Kreuk and Allison Mack were members of Nxivm.&nbsp;Kristin recruited Allison."</p><p>Dones herself was a member.</p><p>Before you worry, it doesn’t sound like Kristin Kreuk&nbsp;has anybody’s initials branded near her genitals.</p><p>"But Kristin left shortly after I left in 2009. She got out before it became really bizarre and wasn’t involved with anything sexual."</p><p>Dones&nbsp;speaks about when and why she left:</p><p>"I joined in 2000 and left in 2009 when I found out&nbsp;that Keith Raniere was manipulating women into having sex with him. He&nbsp;wouldn’t&nbsp;approach the women for sex&nbsp;directly. He would send one of the women working for him, a&nbsp;woman named Pat, on his behalf."</p><p>It sounds like a precursor to Allison Mack’s current job.</p><p>"Pat&nbsp;would say to the chosen woman, ‘Keith wants to spend some one on one time with you.’"</p><p>And when you’re in a cult, you want to spend time with the leader.</p><p>"Whatever they were doing with&nbsp;their lives, whether it was acting or&nbsp;business&nbsp;or a sport they were good at, they would be told Keith can help you if you spend some one on one time and she could set that up. He would meet them and do his seduction thing."</p><p>We don’t care to imagine what Keith Raniere’s&nbsp;alleged "seduction thing" looks like.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/allison-mack-682x1024.jpg><p>These days, Allison Mack is still submitting to Keith Raniere’s will.</p><p>She reportedly eats only 500 to 800 calories per day, which is absolutely not enough food.</p><p>She is also said to run 40 miles a week.</p><p>All of this is to keep herself incredibly thin, per DOS’ requirements. With authority comes very high standards.</p><p>Women within DOS who fail to obey Allison Mack’s orders are reportedly paddled as punishment, reinforcing Keith Raniere’s will.</p><p>As for Allison’s particular responsibilities?</p><p>Why, she’s allegedly in charge of selecting women to be Keith’s sex partners.</p><p>All the while, <a href=#>Allison Mack continues to praise NXIVM and recruit more "slaves"</a> to the cause.</p><p>There is, unfortunately, no part of this story that isn’t gross an alarming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/kristin-kreuk-hairstyle-683x1024.jpg><p>So both women were recruited while filming Smallville in Vancouver.</p><p>Kristin apparently got into it because her boyfriend was part of NXIVM. There are a few men involved in the organization, but it sounds like DOS is made up entirely of women.</p><p>And Keith Raniere.</p><p>We’re glad that Kristin got out as early as she did, but so saddened that Allison Mack did not.</p><p>We can’t imagine how Kristin or any other former recruiter must feel, knowing what they got other women into. Even if they had no idea, it’s a lot to live with.</p><p>And we can’t help but wonder how many other familiar faces might be part of the organization.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>18 Sexy Small Screen Superheroes</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z%2BcK3LpaCsp55iuqKvymaumqtdp7KkvtSiq56cXZ67tbuMrJyxZZOqubV5wbJkrKWRobm3tculnGabn6jBor6MpKlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

He led the National League in groundballs induced by 65.9% on the season.</span></p><p><span>His strength was a double-play ball, a role that was possible with his high-90s sinking fastball. </span>He remained with the Nationals for the year and made his first playoff appearance.</p><p><span>The team won in Game 2 against the <a href=#>Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and lost in Game 4 in the 2016 National League Division Series because of him.</span></p><p><span>For the 2017 season, the Nationals named Blake as their closing pitcher.</span></p><p><span>On Opening Day, Treinen pitched a perfect inning in the top of the ninth against the Miami Marlins with two strikeouts to end the game, earning the save, the second of his career.</span></p><p><span>In a couple of weeks, he achieved a 7.11 ERA and was removed from the role for Shawn Kelley and then Koda Glover.</span></p><p><span>In June, Treinen’s batting average on balls in play against him gradually regressed toward his career norms.</span></p><p><span>He retook the role to close out the ninth inning of a 4-2 game against the Chicago Cubs on June 29.

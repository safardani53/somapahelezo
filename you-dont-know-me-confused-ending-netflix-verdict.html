He swears he's innocent, but in the end, the only thing that matters, is if you believe his story or not."</p><p>As gripping as the story is, it starts to get a bit confusing towards the end of the series.</p><p>In the final episode, viewers watch two alternate endings which play out for the protagonist.</p><p>One where a guilty verdict is decided, and one where is found not guilty.</p><p>This has scrambled the heads of its fans, who are desperate to know what exactly happened to Hero.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Streaming</h2></p><p>Those who watched the confusing ending headed to Twitter to rant.</p><p>One wrote: "You Don’t Know Me&nbsp;on Netflix should be called&nbsp;You Don’t Know The Outcome."</p><p>Another said: "So did he get guilty or not guilty on&nbsp;You Don’t Know Me&nbsp;on Netflix???? So annoyed with the ending."</p><p>"How they gonna end&nbsp;You Don’t Know Me&nbsp;on Netflix like that" and "The ending of&nbsp;You Don’t Know Me…. @netflix we need answers." wrote another fan.</p><p>As another viewer asked: "Please watch, “You don’t know me” on Netflix, and tell me what the ending means; because I am mad!!! <a href=#>#YouDontKnowMe</a>"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/you-don-t-know-me-viewers-all-have-the-same-complaint-about-the-netflix-show-1655905851.jpeg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGloboVxhY9pZrKnpWKxsLrTZqKnp6diuqZ5wqiln62jmrFusc2doKefXaOytbLLoq9mrpWnsaqv02g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

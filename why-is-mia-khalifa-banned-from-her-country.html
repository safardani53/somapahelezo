It's her recent unabashed trolling of Israelis and pro-violence sentiments that are shocking many, including her business associates.</p><p>Here's an example of part of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> she shared: "I just wanna make sure there’s 4K footage of my people breaking down the walls of the open air prison they’ve been forced out of their homes and into so we have good options for the history books that write about how how they freed themselves from apartheid."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>, an outlet Mia has openly sparred with in the past, she also encouraged attackers to film "horizontal" for a better viewing experience.</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> attacked <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>, who deleted her own post about the Israel-Palestine conflict after backlash.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just wanna make sure there’s 4k footage of my people breaking down the walls of the open air prison they’ve been forced out of their homes and into so we have good options for the history books that write about how how they freed themselves from apartheid.

Reportedly, after she launched her career in adult entertainment, the country "verbally banned" her, with Muslims taking special offense to Mia <a href=#>wearing a hijab</a> in some of her racy content.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking</a> to Mouin Ali Jaber and Medea Azouri on the Sarde (After Dinner) podcast, Mia explained about returning to Lebanon, “The only reason I haven’t before is because I didn’t feel safe going. I know that I have been verbally banned. I don’t know if my name is actually at the airport but even having a few people say, ‘Don’t you dare ever come here, we’ll kill you,’ that will scare anybody from going somewhere.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mia Khalifa's social media posts applauding Palestinian violence got her fired from the Todd Shapiro podcast.</h2><p>In light of Mia's headline-making online activism, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian broadcaster</a> and radio host Todd Shapiro publicly fired the former <a href=#>porn star</a>, sharing on X that he no longer plans to work with her.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is such a horrendous tweet <a href=#>@miakhalifa</a>.

"Consider yourself fired effective immediately," Todd added, calling her words, "Simply disgusting. Beyond disgusting."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He then tweeted, "Please evolve and become a better human being. The fact you are condoning death, rape, beatings, and hostage taking is truly gross. No words can explain your ignorance.We need humans to come together, especially in the face of tragedy. I pray for you to become a better person. However, it clearly seems like it's too late for you."</p><p>Not surprisingly, Mia seemed unfazed by the termination of their professional relationship, responding in part, "Please worry about your sad little company lacking direction and purpose before you utter my name again. I stand with all people fighting oppression, now and always."</p><p>She added, "Do your research before begging for my investment in your little project. I’m from Lebanon.

millions.</p><p>The Grade-I listed Leazes Terrace, which dates back to the 19th century, in&nbsp;<a href=#>Newcastle</a>&nbsp;sits just metres away from the East Stand of <a href=#>St James' Park</a>, where the <a href=#>Magpies</a> play their home matches next to the city centre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

to make way for a bigger <a href=#>football</a> stadium.</p><p>But locals say they're no further forward about the future of their <a href=#>homes</a> after rumours circulated they could make way in order for&nbsp;Newcastle&nbsp;United to expand the 52,000-seater ground.</p><p>Earlier this month, the club sent out a survey to its fans asking for their take on how to enhance the stadium itself.</p><p>The Newcastle faithful were asked to give their thoughts on a number of issues, including stadium expansion, a new stadium being built, hospitality and club suites, ticket pricing, matchday offerings and other aspects such as if they would be willing to attend concerts at the ground in the future.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Newcastle United">Read More on Newcastle United</h2><p>The move comes after the club brought experts in to conduct a feasibility study to look into every possibility of stadium expansion and enhance the matchday experience.</p><p>The flats, which were built in the 1830s, are made up of a rectangular shape with student accommodation on the side closest to the stadium and private residencies at the other end.</p><p>Rumours suggested the <a href=#>football</a> club could pursue a Compulsory Purchase Order to acquire the flats, or alternatively the residents could be "bought out" if they agree to accept a sum of cash.</p><p>Semi-retired doctor Philip Griffiths, 66, said: "I know potentially that we can be bought out but I don't think that would be easy.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>"We are aware there are plans to extend the stadium here, or to move it somewhere else.</p><p>"There are lots of crazy rumours swirling around including knocking down the student side and bringing the football stand closer to our door.</p><p>"I also heard about the potential for a Compulsory Purchase Order to be made but I think there are precedents for listed buildings being purchased and I think they would have to keep the facade.</p><p>"I have no complaints to the football club and they have been better neighbours since they were taken over but it does make you concerned.</p><p>"The worst-case scenario for us is them keeping our side as it is, but demolishing the student flats next to the stand to make the ground bigger.</p><p>"That would mean the ground would almost be in our back garden."</p><p>One resident, who has lived in the stone terrace for over a decade, said nobody knows what the future holds.</p><p>Wishing to remain anonymous, he said: "Nobody has told us anything about what might happen to Leazes Terrace.</p><p>"People have asked about what we think of the new proposed development but no one has informed us as residents which isn't helpful.</p><p>"The building has been here longer than the football club and it's a listed building.</p><p>"Even if the company bought us out, I don't know if they could demolish the building."</p><p>The section of student accommodation was sold to a Middle Eastern group which sparked rumours among some&nbsp;Newcastle&nbsp;supporters that the residents could be bought out given the club's ownership links to <a href=#>Saudi Arabia</a>.</p><p>The homeowner added: "The whole thing makes you wonder if discussions are going on behind your back because we haven't heard anything from the club or the council.</p><p>"Most people like living here and I think it's a lovely terrace.</p><p>"Newcastle&nbsp;hasn't got many buildings like this so as a resident of the city it would be a huge shame if something happened to it.</p><p>"I believe the football club have got some sort of investment in the student side of the building but we just don't know.</p><p>"It's a lovely place to live and we don't get any trouble with the football matches so we don't want to be moved."</p><p>Andy Cliff, 32, who works in IT, said: "The only plan I was aware of was a bridge going across from the stadium to another building.</p><p>"I have no idea about plans to affect Leazes Terrace but it would be concerning if the building was at risk.</p><p>"But I would be surprised if that was be possible due to the nature of the building and its historic value.</p><p>"I don't take any notice of when the football is on so I'm not in the loop with their plans but as a resident I've not heard anything.</p><p>"It's a great location to live and it's so close to the city centre and it would be slightly worrying but I don't think it will get to that point."</p><p>Another woman, who's lived on the row for over 20 years, said: "As far as I'm aware the building is a Grade-I listed building so I don't think they can do anything.</p><p>"They tried many years ago but an elderly woman fought it and she won.</p><p>"I love living here so if someone wanted to offer me zillions of pounds over the asking price then brilliant, but I think that is very unlikely.</p><p>"I'm a&nbsp;Newcastle&nbsp;United supporter myself so I'm not against extending the stadium but I'm not worried about the future of these homes.</p><p>"I would be concerned if expanding the stadium blocked out our natural light but deep down I don't think they can really move us."</p><p>A&nbsp;Newcastle&nbsp;City Council spokesperson said: “The debate about the future of St James Park has gone on for many years - all the way back to the days of Sir John Hall when there was talk about it moving to the protected Leazes Park.</p><p>“The club own the Strawberry Place site, but we have not been formally approached by them about any plans for expansion.</p><p>“They have said publicly they are committed to St James Park, and without doubt its location in the heart of the city centre is one of its greatest strengths, close to <a href=#>hotels</a>, <a href=#>public transport</a> and easy to access.</p><p>“In planning terms, it is a challenging site - close to a conservation area and listed buildings on one side and a Metro station and tunnels on the other.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“That said, the city council would like to see the club remain where it is&nbsp;because culturally and socially it is the beating heart of the city, and we will support the club as much as we can."</p><p>The Sun Online has contacted Newcastle United for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

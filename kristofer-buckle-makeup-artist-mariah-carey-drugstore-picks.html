NEUTROGENA HEALTHY SKIN LIQUID MAKEUP</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/AV_MAKEUP_ARTIST4jpg-JS868773329.jpg><p>Buckle said he adores a foundation by Giorgio Armani called Liquid Silk Foundation, but the item retails for about $70.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucky for Americans, he said <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Neutrogena Healthy Skin Liquid Makeup</a> gets a “very similar” job done.&nbsp;</p><p>“A beautiful hydrating makeup that looks very natural, and it just performs well, and it's a fraction of the cost available at most drugstores.”</p><p>Amazon is currently selling it for about 50% off, retailing at $9.56.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. MAYBELLINE INSTANT AGE REWIND ERASER</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/AV_MAKEUP_ARTIST5jpg-JS868773330.png><p>The makeup artist said when you put blush on someone’s face, you’re trying to simulate blood flow through their skin as if they were blushing.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser</a> might make Americans blush when they realize its fabulosity is bottled for $8.99.&nbsp;</p><p>Buckle hinted it’s one of the brand’s best sellers for a reason.&nbsp;</p><p>“Complexion makeup is something people go through more quickly because you use it every day and use more of it usually,” Buckle said.&nbsp;</p><p>Using this affordable quality pick will quickly rack up in <a href=#>savings</a>.</p><p>“It has a sponge applicator, so it's easy to apply, but they also make neutralizing colors that are really great for concealing dark spots and blueness around the eye,” Buckle added.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. L’OREAL VOLUMINOUS ORIGINAL</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/AV_MAKEUP_ARTIST6jpg-JS868773335.png><p>Mascara is a product Buckle said consumers should replace at least once a month, even if it’s not finished.&nbsp;</p><p>“Because it's so close to the eye, and it's something that goes on your eyelashes, it can collect bacteria,” Buckle said. “And it also dries out as you're using it.”</p><p>He said people can spend $40 or $50 on mascara at department store brands. But he suggested trying <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">L’Oreal Voluminous Original </a>instead, retailing at <a href=#>Target</a> for $8.99.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as quality? “It's totally comparable to high-end products,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. REVLON SUPER LUSTROUS MOISTURIZING CREAM LIPSTICK&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/AV_MAKEUP_ARTIST7jpg-JS868773336.png><p>“Revlon lipstick is one of those things that most formulas are great in drugstores,” Buckle said. “Some are better than others, but most of the products are good.”</p><p>He said lipstick and eyeshadow are two items women are inspired most by makeup trends on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>So, for him, Revlon is a great way to experiment with various lipstick styles without breaking the bank.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Revlon Super Lustrous Moisturizing Cream Lipstick</a> is one of his favorites and is on sale at Walmart for $5.50.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. CERAVE SKIN RENEWING NIGHT CREAM FACE MOISTURIZER&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/AV_MAKEUP_ARTIST8jpg-JS868773338.jpg><p>“Moisturizer is something you can spend a lot of money on,” Buckle said. “And there are great products that are hundreds of dollars, even thousands.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the celebrity makeup artist came with a cheaper alternative to keep your skin smooth.</p><p>He suggested <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream Face Moisturizer</a> for Americans seeking to moisturize their faces without liquidating their wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>It retails at Target for $20, but savvy consumers will find it on Amazon for $14.61.</p><p>Buckle advised checking pricing among all competitors because there’s no rhyme or reason to what drugstore item will be cheaper where.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And at last, the makeup legend had one secret for makeup lovers: ask drugstores about their return policy.</p><p>Rite Aid, for example, he said, allows people to experiment with makeup and will accept returns on used items you don’t like.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>A makeup artist said you're wasting money on <a href=#>three popular</a> products.</p><p>A viral <a href=#>$12 product</a> has been dubbed the "perfect dupe" for the $66 designer version.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfboV6gJdtbWijop7AtbvFnqlmmqWYuK2xjKaYpJ2lpXqivtOiqq1lnZa%2Fqq3HZpqaqpWueqW%2B1KCqraeimnqxtcKkqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

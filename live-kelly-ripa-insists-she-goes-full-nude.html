Ryan wondered.</p><p>"No! Guess what? I go full nude," Kelly shouted to the audinece.</p><p>There were a few hollers from the audience and Ryan just chuckled.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>WHAT THE KELL!</h2><p>Kelly is not one to hold back when talking about NSFW topics on or off air.</p><p>Earlier this month, she let a <a href=#>detail about her sex life</a> with husband, Mark Consuelos, slip on her podcast, Let's Talk off Camera.</p><p>The&nbsp;Live&nbsp;host bared all during a preview for an episode where she spoke to psychotherapist Dr. Oma Guralnik.</p><p>Kelly's&nbsp;<a href=#>podcast</a>&nbsp;finds her speaking with a variety of guests.</p><p>They discuss topics that she can't always cover on the show.</p><p>This particular episode's topic includes sex and adjacent content, most of which wouldn't be too appropriate for the family nature of Live with Kelly and Mark.</p><p>But she was likely a bit more candid than she planned to be in the preview clip.</p><p>"I knew we were doing this episode, and I'm like 'wow, we haven't had sex in about two weeks," Kelly said in a clip posted to her Instagram Stories.</p><p>"I better have sex before the episode," she joked.</p><p>"Two weeks, is that a record for you?" her guest asked.</p><p>The pair laughed about the comment, but it seemed that it actually might be.</p><h2>ORANGE YOU GLAD</h2><p>Kelly went&nbsp;<a href=#>topless in the shower</a>&nbsp;in an NSFW video as she tested out how eating oranges while in there can be beneficial.</p><p>On the August 1 episode of Live, Kelly mentioned she had read about the benefits of eating oranges while showering.</p><p>"I read this article about why you should eat oranges in the shower," she attested during the beginning of the show.</p><p>"I found it fascinating and weird and we tried it," she said.</p><p>"They are saying that when you eat oranges in the shower, it's the benefit of the scene, the aromatherapy of it all, which I think can probably be achieved by essential oils," Kelly explained of what she had read.</p><p>She continued: "They're saying another practical reason in the shower is so that the juice doesn't get everywhere."</p><p>Kelly could hardly stifle a grin as she quipped: "I say if you're an adult and eating an orange and getting juice everywhere, then perhaps switch to a less juicy fruit."</p><p>Then the show played footage of Kelly doing exactly what she had read about with a racy look at the host.</p><p>In the shower, Kelly is topless and eating an orange, then wraps the skin around her neck and on her shoulder.</p><p>"You can't tell, but I am showering," she said.</p><p>The water came on as she continued eating in the clip.</p><p>The audience clapped and laughed at the visual joke.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Then there were shots of producer&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Gelman</a>&nbsp;flashing onscreen washing himself.</p><p>"I will say that if Gelman can show his nipples, I'm not sure why I can't show mine," Kelly joked as Michael had remained in full view while wearing no shirt in his photos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/chp-newsint-co-uk-chp-838180246.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/real-kell-live-s-kelly-809274346.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/kelly-ripa-52-shocks-fans-785632786-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwaGmCeYGRaKOirpViuKa4y7Jkq6GglnqqutKiqq2rXai1pnnGqJysZZaqua15za6bnmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;

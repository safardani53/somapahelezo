After maternity leave, basically what normal companies do for women?” Mia quips as stunned VIP manager <strong>Maddi Reese</strong> watches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Southern-Hospitalitys-Mia-Alario-Accuses-Boss-Leva-Bonaparte-of-Being-a-Hypocrite-With-Drinking-Rule-Feature.jpg><p>Leva, who co-owns Republic Garden & Bar with her husband, <strong>Lamar Bonaparte</strong>, is once again surprised by Mia’s tone. “What are you doing, Mia?” she asks, to which Mia replies, “I’m upset.”</p><p>When pushed further, Mia tells Leva she’s unsettled by “the hypocrisy you are showing as a boss,” which only <a href=#>angers Leva even more</a>.</p><p>“What are you talking about? If you are back of the house and you are drinking, [that’s an] immediate fire,” Leva fires back. “That’s the rule. Have you ever read your manual? If you drink back here, you’re done.”</p><p>Mia claims she doesn’t “understand” where Leva is coming from, adding, “I don’t get it.” The <a href=#>Southern Charm</a> star appears to be at her wits’ end with Mia and responds, “I don’t need you to get it.”</p><p>In one last effort to sway Leva into seeing her side, Mia claims, “Employees have drank here so many times.” The statement, however, prompts Leva to ask, “OK, so who did I keep in here who is drinking back there?” hinting that anyone else who is caught with alcohol while on shift will be terminated.</p><p>While Maddi, 26, keeps her mouth shut in the preview, she opened up to Us earlier this month about the uncomfortable moment she witnessed between Leva and Mia.</p><p>“Leva definitely brings the hammer down this season on what we’re doing at work, whether it be our uniforms or drinking or anything like that,” Maddi exclusively explained to Us. “So, literally, I think most of us were worried about our jobs.”</p><p>She insisted that Leva was not on a “power trip” despite what <a href=#>some of her castmates may say</a> about their boss after the strict enforcement of the “no drinking” rule.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think that Leva cares about her business. [If] you allow drinking, [then] what else [will happen]?” Maddi said. “I feel like Leva cares about our company and wants us to succeed. But sometimes I feel like our cast members are, like, ‘OK, take your foot off the brake. Trust us that we can do our jobs and we do them well.’ But at the end of the day, it’s her business. She’s passionate about it just as much as us, but she wants to make sure it’s doing the best that it can.”</p><p>Southern Hospitality season 2 premieres on Bravo Thursday, December 7, at 9 p.m. ET. New episodes will be available the next day on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqoraSdsrO6jKGmrKiZqa6ttdOyZJykmaV6rrXAZpilmaKevG6yyKCfratdl7y0v4ylnK%2BZXZe8r63PmqmtnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

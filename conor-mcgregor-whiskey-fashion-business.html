His ventures into the whiskey and fashion have contributed to his astonishing rise in wealth.</p><p>In 2018, he launched Proper No. Twelve into the crowded whiskey market, which reportedly made £750 million in its first year. It is not known how much his stake was in the company, though.</p><p>Last year, he sold that stake in the business to Proximo Spirits to swell his bank account furthermore.</p><p>He also <a href=#>teamed up with American clothier David August Heil</a>, the man famous for designing his infamous 'F*** You' suit, and embarked on a menswear label a year later, which is said to make £50m in profits-per-year.</p><h2>WHISKEY A-GO-GO</h2><p>Before taking on Khabib Nurmagomedov, McGregor became a one-stop promotional tool for Proper No. Twelve.</p><p>Every press conference saw McGregor clutching a bottle gleefully, announcing his latest business idea to the crowded room.</p><p>He also revealed where the name for the whiskey came from.</p><p>He said: “I come from a place called Crumlin, in Dublin 12.</p><p>"It’s a place dear to my heart. It’s where I learned how to fight, it made me who I am today."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000433316616-e1578496821214.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/7EB5EA29-7C77-488A-97E8-56954FC7B12C.png><p>“It’s a place I’m still very much a part of every single day of my life. So, that’s where the name came from. It’s proper Irish whiskey and twelve is my hometown."</p><p>When it finally came to launching the drink on a dry run at the end of 2018, it completely sold out.</p><p>In fact, at one point<a href=#> in Tesco Ireland stores</a> customers were only allowed to buy two bottles at a time.</p><p>And the showman's penchant as a salesman must've paid off when he revealed the official figures in its first year of business.</p><p>Taking to Instagram, McGregor wrote: "Over $1b generated in Whiskey sales in my first year! Like it or not, there is a new King in town! Proper Whiskey, liquid sunshine!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000478597714.jpg><p>The whiskey is such a hit in America the company sold six months' worth of stock in its first 10 days of trading.</p><p>It sold 2.4million bottles in its first six months of trading.</p><p>However, the brand was taken over by Proximo and is worth over $600million.</p><p>Despite selling up, McGregor is still the face of Proper No Twelve and markets the brand.<br></p><h2>CHARITY CASE</h2><p>Initially, Proper Twelve also aided charities.</p><p>On launch he said: "First responders all over the world are the unsung heroes who act with courage and answer the call of duty every day for people in need.</p><p>“I have great respect for these men and women. The company has committed to donate $5 for every case sold to local first responder organisations/charities, up to $1 million annually.</p><p>"The organisations/charities will be identified for each state and country around the world and donations will go directly to specific states and countries where sales take place."</p><p>Last year, he said Proper No. Twelve would donate to Australian first responders after the bushfire disaster.</p><h2>HE'S IN FASHION</h2><p>Known for his sharp suits and sharp tongue, McGregor, who once called David Beckham his fashion icon, has always enjoyed splashing his cash on fashion.</p><p>Before he fought Floyd Mayweather in 2017, the Irishman was seen in various suits designed by David August Heil - a man responsible for ensuring the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Will Smith, and Robert Downey Jr are red carpet-ready.</p><p>On closer inspection, stitched into the lining, you could see the words 'F*** You' etched onto the flashy garments.</p><p>At one fitting the pair decided that they should collaborate together.</p><p>"We casually chatted about doing a line together but we finally got serious over the past several months," he said before the main event against 'Money' Mayweather.</p><p>"I credit David [Heil] with creating the look that has become a signature of mine and there’s no other person I know who understands how fashion can change a person — physically, mentally and emotionally."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000439253516.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000338074997.jpg><h2>LAUNCH TIME</h2><p>After a delay, the 'Drop 1 Look Book' collection saw the release of limited edition t-shirts, hoodies and caps.</p><p>Incredibly, the clobber costing roughly between £40-£120 sold out in just a day.</p><p>"Our audience is seriously committed and loyal," Heil told The Irish Sun.</p><p>“We sold out of a couple of styles within the first 24 hours of launching the site and we didn’t really promote it other than our immediate followers and Conor’s fanbase.”</p><p>August McGregor later introduced tailored suits to their range, as well as winter jackets as his empire continues to grow.</p><p>It has been estimated that the clothing line brings in a staggering £50m in profits per year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000476152556.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000364083277-e1578498147364.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000435595447.jpg><h2>SPONSORSHIPS AND THE DIGITAL AGE</h2><p>In 2018, upon a signing a multi-million pound six-fight deal with the UFC, McGregor renewed a contract with Monster Energy drinks worth somewhere in the region of £750,000-per-year.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest MMA News</h2></p><p>Brand McGregor also appeals to Reebok, who use him as one of their famous endorsors and offd him around £4m-per-year.</p><p>And digitally, McGregor knows what's up when it comes to selling himself.</p><p>He has investments in tech products like The MacTalk App, which allows fans to download McGregor soundbites for £1.09 a pop, as well as his own website, TheMacLife.com - a MMA media outlet and news website dedicated to the man, who can't help but generate money with his name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH5xgphwbW5oX5i8r7vRZqScn6KatLC%2BjLCfoqubmsZussCsn6KnnmKvtr%2FIp5ysq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;

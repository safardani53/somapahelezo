When the Netflix series premiered in March 2019, Stause was married to <a href=#><strong>Justin Hartley</strong></a>, but seven months later, the <a href=#>This Is Us</a> star surprised fans — <a href=#>and his then-wife</a> — <a href=#>by filing for divorce</a>.</p><p>Selling Sunset covered the surprise filing in the season 2 finale, leaving fans wondering what happened between the former costars and setting a precedent for even more personal drama to follow.</p><p>Like Stause, <strong><a href=#>Heather Rae Young</a></strong> saw her love life become a subject of interest in season 2. After breaking up with <strong>Nick Ebert</strong>, the hockey player with whom she had a long-distance relationship in season 1, Young started dating <a href=#><strong>Tarek El Moussa</strong></a>, who was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Christina Haack</strong></a>.</p><p>Their romance quickly became the subject of much discussion at the Oppenheim Group, perhaps most famously when <a href=#><strong>Amanza Smith</strong></a> questioned whether Young had met El Moussa’s children in the relationship.</p><p>Nearly two years later after meeting, however, the former model and the <a href=#>Flip or Flop</a> cohost are still going strong <a href=#>and got engaged in July 2020</a> before tying the knot in October 2021. Young also has a friendly relationship with Haack, who shares daughter Taylor (born in 2010) and son Brayden (born in 2015) with El Moussa.</p><p>“We coparent very well together,” <a href=#>Young told Us Weekly of Haack</a> in April 2021. “We communicate daily about the kids, and they’re the most important thing in the world to all of us. So, as long as the kids are happy, we’re all happy.”</p><p>It seems likely that the relationship drama will only continue, especially given that Stause started dating Oppenheim Group cofounder <a href=#><strong>Jason Oppenheim</strong></a> in July 2021. After <a href=#>photos of the pair cuddling up during a vacation</a> made waves on social media, <a href=#>the businessman confirmed their relationship</a> to Us in a statement.</p><p>“Chrishell and I became close friends and it has developed into an amazing relationship,” he explained. “I care about her deeply and we’re very happy together.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us confirmed in December 2021 <a href=#>that the pair had split.</a></p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about the Selling Sunset cast and their love lives:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKa4y6KloGWjqru0sdNmmpqrpGLEqbuMrZ%2BeZaOprrO%2FjKGYr51dma61scNmpp%2BeXaiws7HEp2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

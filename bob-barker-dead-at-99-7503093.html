"We were great friends over these 40 yrs. He will be missed.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barker is survived by his half-brother Kent Valandra and half-nephews Robert Valandra and Chip Valandra, as well as a half-niece, Vickie Valandra Kelly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jesse Grant/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The TV personality has battled various health problems in the past few years. In January 2019, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>paramedics were called to Barker's Hollywood Hills home</a> after he fell at his residence. Although an ambulance was on the scene, he was not hospitalized.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Several months earlier, Barker's manager confirmed to PEOPLE that an ambulance and the fire department responded to his Hollywood Hills home for a "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>non-emergency back problem</a>" in October 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afterwards, his manager said Barker was "fine and resting at home." The incident came more than a year after he fell and hit his head at his home in June 2017.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barker served as the host of The Price Is Right for 35 years before announcing his retirement at the age of 87. His last episode on the iconic show, now hosted by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Drew Carey</a>, was in 2007.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fans often waited hours outside CBS TV City in Los Angeles just to hear Barker utter the famous phrase, "And the actual retail price is…."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tibrina Hobson/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When he eventually retired, even Barker had reservations about leaving the gig that turned him into a TV icon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have thought every year for the last 10 or 15 years that maybe I should quit, and then I think, 'No, I'll do it for another year,'" he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2007.

It was only a matter of days before he secured his first hosting gig on Truth or Consequences, where he worked for 18 years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He began hosting The Price Is Right on CBS in 1972. An overnight hit, it became the longest-running game show in U.S. history and turned Barker into the longest-tenured game show host.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Barker's fame helped him to land several big-screen roles, including in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Adam Sandler</a>'s 1996 comedy Happy Gilmore, his work in TV remained his crowning achievement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's probably hard to believe, but I have thoroughly enjoyed doing this show for all these years," Barker once told Entertainment Weekly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barker was previously married to wife Dorothy Jo for 36 years before her death in 1981.

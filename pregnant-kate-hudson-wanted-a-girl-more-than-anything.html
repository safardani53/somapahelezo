Kate has had the baby itch and wanted a girl more than anything,” the source explains.</p><p>“She has a special bond with her niece, Rio, and really wanted to experience having a daughter of her own,” the source adds, referring to the Bride Wars star’s brother <strong><a href=#>Oliver Hudson</a></strong> and his wife<strong> Erinn Barlett</strong>’s 4-year-old daughter. (The couple also have two sons: Wilder, 10, and Bodhi, 8.)</p><p>Hudson, 38, started dating Fujikawa in December 2016 after meeting him 15 years earlier. She has two sons from previous relationships: Ryder, 14, whom she shares with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Chris Robinson</strong> </a>and Bingham, 6, whose father is Hudson’s ex-fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Matthew Bellamy.</strong></a></p><p>“Once she met Danny she just knew that she wanted a baby with him and hoped and prayed that it would happen. For it to be a girl is just the icing on the cake,” the source tells Us. “Danny is so good with kids and has been great with her boys.”</p><p>As previously reported, Hudson <a href=#>shocked fans with her pregnancy news on</a> Friday via Instagram.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“SURPRISE!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’ve wondered why I’ve been so absent on my social channels it’s because I have never been more sick! It was the most sick first trimester of all my children,” the&nbsp;Golden Globe winner captioned a video of herself, Fujikawa, Ryder and Bingham holding balloons filled with pink confetti. “Boomerangs have made me nauseous, Superzoom is an easy way to have my head in the toilet, food instagrams make me queezy and thinking too much about insta stories made me even more exhausted than I already had been. If you’ve seen me out and about smiling and pretending like everything is amazing…I was lying!”</p><p>“BUT! I have broken through on the other end of that and rediscovering the joys of insta/snap,” she continued. “We have been trying to keep this pregnancy under the radar for as long as possible but I’m a poppin now! And it’s too darn challenging to hide, and frankly hiding is more exhausting then just coming out with it! My kids, Danny, myself and the entire family are crazy excited! A little girl on the way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602aimqyVYrW2sNKopWavkaPBprCMmmSgoaKheq670Z5kraCRo3qiutitn6Kml2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 35, and Thompson, 29, stood next to each other in the kitchen of his Los Angeles home as they held up their phones to record Oguz, 30, blowing out the candles on his cake.

They <a href=#>broke up</a> in February 2019 after the basketball player was <a href=#>caught kissing</a> <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>’s then-BFF <a href=#><strong>Jordyn Woods</strong></a> at a house party. Thompson previously cheated on Kardashian <a href=#>with multiple women while she was pregnant</a> with their daughter, <a href=#>True</a>.</p><p>Since their split, the former couple have maintained an amicable relationship while raising their now-2-year-old. The NBA star, who also shares son Prince, 3, with ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Jordan Craig</strong></a>, has also made several <a href=#>attempts to win back the reality star</a>, although she has not budged.</p><p>“They are <a href=#>happily coparenting</a>,” a source told Us Weekly exclusively in February. “There are no plans for them to get back together.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Khloe-Kardashian-and-Tristan-Thompson-Look-Awfully-Cozy-at-Friend-Birthday-Party-2.jpg><p>Us broke the news in March that the pair had been <a href=#>quarantining together amid the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. A source said at the time, “Khloé doesn’t have bad or negative feelings toward Tristan at this point. Being quarantined has made her have a soft spot for him, and she knows he will always be part of her life in some way because he is True’s dad. Khloé has been open and receptive toward Tristan.”</p><p>A second insider revealed in May that Kardashian and Thompson, who <a href=#>threw a joint Trolls-themed birthday party</a> for True a month prior, were “very much <a href=#>acting like a couple</a>” while self-isolating together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoJyksm63wKubmquYnq6vedOroKyskaN6tbTOpqesp55iubC7ymaaqLKpYq61ecWroJ6mlKh6sa3RrbBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

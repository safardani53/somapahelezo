The Palestinian prisoner is presently in the spotlight as a result of his recent death.</p><h2>Khader Adnan Died as a Result of a Hunger Strike by Palestinian Prisoners.</h2><p>Khader Adnan died as a result of a hunger strike, as the Palestinian prisoner died in an Israeli jail after 86 days of fasting. The Palestinian Prisoners Society broke the news, which astonished every one.&nbsp;According to the Israel Prison Service (IPS), Adnan was discovered unresponsive early Tuesday and was transported to the hospital, but all efforts to revive him failed. According to the IPS, Adnan refused to undergo medical testing and treatment. Following the announcement, terrorists launched at least three missiles from the Gaza Strip, but no one was harmed.

According to the Inmates Affairs Authority, the Palestinian Prisoners Society, and the inmates’ institutions, the Israeli Prison Service officially announced Adnan’s death after his hunger strike.</p><p>Adnan had been on a hunger strike for about 86 days, protesting his arbitrary imprisonment, according to the Ministry of Prisoners and Ex-Prisoners Affairs. The prisoners were informed of Adnan’s martyrdom, as he was in extremely critical condition and on the verge of death, owing to the Israeli authorities refusal to respond to his demands and disregard for his medical needs by placing him in a cell despite his deteriorating health after 86 days of hunger strike.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Khader-Adnan-2.jpg alt="Khader Adnan" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Khader Adnan’s Health Prior to Death</h2><p>People are looking for information on Khader Adnan’s health after his death. However, there were few specifics regarding it. According to Israeli jail officials, Adnan refused to undergo medical testing and treatment.&nbsp;Adnan’s lawyer accused Israel of medical malpractice. According to reports, Israel was requested to be transferred to a civilian hospital so that he could be properly monitored. Unfortunately, the Israeli jail officials responded with rigidity and denial of such a demand. Adnan was also married to Randa Mousa. Mousa told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that her husband was being kept in a clinic at the Ramla prison in central Israel.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioZmUmr9urcOnmKerXaSvqsDUmqmyZZikxG6wyJ1koZ1dmbamecKarKydXaSzbrDEmquhZZSawaK1y6xm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

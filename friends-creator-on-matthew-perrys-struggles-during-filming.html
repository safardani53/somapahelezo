Luckily, he had the support of the team behind the scenes.</p><p>“We were certainly aware of some of it and we certainly had some conversations about it,” cocreator <strong>Marta Kauffman</strong>&nbsp;told Us Weekly and other reporters at the Producer Guild Awards on Saturday, January 18. “[We were] protective and, hopefully, supportive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Friends-Creator-Sheds-Light-on-Being-Protective-Over-Matthew-Perry-While-Filming-in-line.jpg><p>Perry, 50, went to rehab twice during his time on the NBC sitcom, which ran from 1994 to 2004. He first got treatment in 1997 and again in 2001.</p><p>Unlike many celebrities in treatment at the time, Perry never hid his addiction from the public.</p><p>“I’ve had a lot of ups and downs in my life and a lot of wonderful accolades, but the best thing about me is that if an alcoholic comes up to me and says, ‘Will you help me stop drinking?’ I will say, ‘Yes. I know how to do that,'” he told <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2015. “When I was in big trouble, it was so public because I was on a TV show that 30 million people were watching. The fact that I [am] on TV makes people listen a little bit more, so I take advantage of that from time to time.”</p><p>During an interview in 2016, he was asked what his least favorite episode of the show was. “<a href=#>I ​don’t remember three years of it</a> so none of those,” he told BBC at the time. “I was a little out of it at the time — somewhere between seasons 3 and 6.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Friends-Creator-Sheds-Light-on-Being-Protective-Over-Matthew-Perry-While-Filming.jpg><p>After his second stint in rehab, the actor opened the Perry House, a sober living home that was run out of his former Malibu home.</p><p>Despite his struggles, Perry has remained close to many of his former cast members. In November 2019, <a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a>, shared a <a href=#>selfie with her onscreen husband</a>. “Guess who I had lunch with today,” Cox, 55, captioned the pic. “I KNOW!! Could I BE any happier? #realfriends.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>David Schwimmer</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Matt LeBlanc</strong></a>, Cox and Perry are all on board for a reunion <a href=#>special at HBO Max</a>.

He’s got to share Mom and Dad.”</p><p>It’s true. And it’s something millions of families have been through.</p><p>At least Tori and Zach have been through this before, right? At least they have the experience of welcoming a baby, right?</p><p>Yes, but that’s "good and bad,” said Tori, who reacted last episode to <a href=#>daughter Lilah being diagnosed as a dwarf</a>.</p><p>“It’s bad for me because I’m like, stressed out about the C-section again, but it’s also good, because I don’t feel like I have to take 17 bags into the hospital room with us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Elsewhere, two more significant changes on Tuesday’s episode focused on Matt Roloff and the family farm.</p><p>With Amy agreeing to sell her parcel of this land and move away, Matt took it upon himself to tear one thing down (a treehouse) and build another one up (a wall).</p><p>“It’s a sad day for me,” the father of four said about ridding his property of the aforementioned treehouse, adding:</p><p>“The day is finally here. It’s finally time to tear down that treehouse.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Matt’s sons, who played on the structure for years as kids, were on hand for the end of this enjoyable era.</p><p>“Emotionally, this is exciting for me.” Zachary said… although Jeremy took a different approach, saying there’s “sense of reminiscing that’s always sad."</p><p>“There will never be another treehouse like this, that’s for sure," Matt told the boys, elaborating on how “there’s a little bit of sadness because it brings back memories.</p><p>"But, you know, it’s dangerous so it’s gotta happen and it’s gotta happen now.”</p><p>Matt revealed that he had no choice but to take this step because he was scared someone was going to fall and break their arm while climbing the rickety old treehouse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As for the other step he took? The <a href=#>building of an actual wall on the farm</a>?</p><p>"It’s very symbolic. It’s more than a fence, it’s a symbol … the farm’s changed," Matt told his ex-wife in an attempt to explain his decision behind the project.</p><p>He and Amy got divorced way back in 2015, of course, but Amy was in the process of moving off the land when this season was filmed, marking, yes, a gigantic change.</p><p>"The fence is really something that indicates the times that are going on with the farm – divorce, I’m moving off, Matt’s on the other side," Amy said on air, adding:</p><p>"So it’s an indication that, yes, we always thought of it as one big property, but this is really two separate properties."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Amy and Matt, who mostly get along very well for ex-spouses, have been fighting a lot more on Little People, Big World.</p><p>It happened again over whether the road between the properties should officially called a flag lot&nbsp;or a neck.</p><p>"I think not being in that kind of relationship with Matt, I’m learning how to find my voice again," Amy said, reflecting on the exchange and concluding:</p><p>"That was just a moment of exerting my thoughts and opinions instead of letting it go, instead of saying, ‘Yeah whatever. Yep you’re right.”</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Amy Roloff Teases “Scary Moment” Ahead on Little People, Big World</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p><strong>Little People, Big World airs on Tuesday nights at 8/7c on TLC.</strong></p><p><strong>What changes will befall the Roloffs next week?!?</strong></p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WBcLjIraulnV2lsrC8y55km6GXYsSwvsudZKudk5a9bsDHnmSeppRivKd5zJqlsmWVp660ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

CVS</h2><ul><li>Price: $24.99</li><li>Score: 18 out of 30</li></ul><h2></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/JF-US-VALENTINES-DAY-FLOWERS-COMP-CVS.jpg><p>Flowers at <a href=#>CVS</a> were most costly as it was $24.99, and after taxes it was $27.21.</p><p>For a dozen of roses, I thought it was a little too expensive.</p><p>There were also two roses that were already withering.</p><p>By day six, they were practically dead.</p><p>CVS flowers came in fourth place for me because it had more roses than Aldi's flowers, but the price for some withering flowers did not impress me.</p><h2>3. COSTCO</h2><ul><li>Price: $16.99</li><li>Score: 22 out of 30</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/JF-US-VALENTINES-DAY-FLOWERS-COMP-COSTCO.jpg><p><a href=#>Costco</a> had to be one of my top favorites of flower arrangements.</p><p>The mix bouquet cost $16.99, but after taxes, the price was $18.50.</p><p>It had a variety of flowers like roses, asters, and carnations, and after six days in water, it still looked lively.</p><p>The arrangement also had layered wrapping - one paper wrapping and one plastic on the exterior.</p><p>Costco is up third as it had one of the better flower arrangements.</p><p>I liked that there was a variety of flowers you can choose at the large chain as well, so for under $20, it was worth it.</p><h2>2.

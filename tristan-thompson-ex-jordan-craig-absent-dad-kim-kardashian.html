That's nice if he's been a good friend to you, but let's consider our sisters before taking to global platforms to defend this man's character."</p><p>Kai then addressed rumors that Tristan pays child support to Jordan for Prince.</p><p>"On another note, to set the record straight, the child support rumors are INACCURATE! Tristan has not paid that child support in a very long time and has stopped paying Prince's school tuition," she wrote.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"Yet he's being applauded for picking-up/dropping-off other kids to school/activities. He hasn't even inquired where Prince goes to school now."</p><p>Kai continued: "Despite it all, my sister continues to work multiple jobs as she has since she was 16 years old, so that Prince will never have to <a href=#>feel a difference</a>. But regardless, stepping up for your son is not all about money it's about the time spent.</p><p>"@RealTristan13 you are NOT a good father if you can't be a good father to ALL of your children."</p><p>In addition to Prince and his two children with Khloe, Tristan is a father to a baby boy that he welcomed with <a href=#>Maralee Nichols</a>.</p><p>The child is the result of an affair he had while he was still with Khloe.</p><p>The Hulu star learned of the pregnancy shortly after she and Tristan agreed to move forward with surrogacy to welcome a second child.</p><h2>MONEY PROBLEMS</h2><p>Jordan keeps a relatively low profile and does not typically speak out against Tristan.</p><p>In August, the athlete learned that his baby mama was fighting to keep her reported massive child support payment.</p><p>At the time, the DailyMail reported that <a href=#>Jordan was receiving $40,000 a month</a> from Tristan to support their son.</p><p>Her sister now claims that's "inaccurate."</p><p>The outlet reported that Jordan was working to ensure that she would continue to receive that money.</p><p>She filed an abstract of judgment in Los Angeles on August 9.</p><p>The document is used to create a public record in case the child support isn't paid.</p><p>Although the judgment was filed, no reports surfaced aside from Jordan's sister Kai's claims online that he's ever been late on or skipped child support.</p><p>There were, however, reports that Tristan's income decreased significantly.</p><p>When the payment was decided on in 2019, Tristan's annual salary was said to be $17.7million.</p><p>It dropped to a reported $9.2million.</p><p>He did not address the money drama.</p><h2>HEFTY PRICE TAG</h2><p>Jordan isn't the only one Tristan is supposed to be <a href=#>paying child support</a> to, however.</p><p>In 2022, it was reported that he was battling with Maralee in court as she demanded <a href=#>$47,000 a month</a> from the Canadian-born athlete.</p><p>At the time, Family law expert Bryan Konoski told The Sun that he expected that Tristan was already <a href=#>shelling out $40,000 a month</a> to Khloe for their daughter True.</p><p>He anticipated the athlete would have to do the same for their son, who hadn't yet been born.</p><p>In December of that year, it was reported that he was ordered to pay Maralee $9,500 each month in child support for her son Theo according to <a href=# aria-label="TMZ (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>.</p><p>The outlet reported that he would likely have to one day pay more but was not on a team or earning income at the time.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Sources also said that he would be listed on Theo's birth certificate.</p><p>Legal documents filed months earlier showed that <a href=# aria-label="Tristan offered to pay Maralee $75,000 (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tristan offered to pay Maralee $75,000</a> instead of paying child support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-continue-681282672.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/los-angeles-lakers-center-tristan-848574715.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/khloe-kardashian-posts-adorable-selfie-840444556.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxYmt%2BeXyPaKuroaOprq9506GmpqijpLtusddmoaiqlJa7bq%2FRmqCgZZGXwKa602abmpxdoLauecqaqZ2Zo522orqO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;

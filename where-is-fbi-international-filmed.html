The outlet reported the filming location ahead of the show's September 2021 premiere. And it makes total sense for FBI: International to film primarily overseas since, in real life, the elite Fly Team also travels outside of the U.S. at the drop of a hat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now that we're in Season 2, the show is still filmed in Europe, where it also takes places. Reported filming locations have also included Pula in Croatia in addition to Hungary. Both countries are common filming locations due to their abilities to act as other countries and cities, as well as the low production costs compared to the U.S.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The real-life Fly Team is based all around the world.</h2><p>FBI: International takes place mostly in Budapest, but in real life, members of the Fly Team have to be ready to go wherever they are needed. In fact, the FBI has offices all around the world in order to serve its agents most efficiently.</p><p>And showrunner Derek Haas told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a> that "the FBI actually has 93 offices in embassies and military bases around the world."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>He added, "The FBI definitely helps partner with host countries on solving crimes." As the series continues, since the real Fly Team is needed around the world, the fictional team of agents in FBI: International may see a similar demand.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will there be an 'FBI: International' Season 3?</h2><p>When FBI: International was renewed for Season 2 on May 9, 2022, it was simultaneously renewed for a third season, so we're pretty pleased to say that yes, there will be a Season 3! Not only that, but a third season means that we could get to see even more beautiful European locations.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don't understand why there's people throwing shade at FBI International, yes it's overseas and yes they spend money on the show. It also has more than 5M viewers every week and it's part of the FBIs. It got a full season after 3 episodes aired and now 2 more.

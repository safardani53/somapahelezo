The statement piece of outerwear featured buttons down the front and a belt that cinched in at the waist. She teamed it with a pair of straight-leg black slacks and black sneakers.</p><p>The 32-year-old model kept her glam simple with matte foundation, black eyeliner, a light pink blush and nude lipstick. She wore her hair straight and down, showing off her bangs that swept straight across her forehead.</p><p>When examining the thick mound of fluffy white fur at the bottom of her coat, we can’t help but imagine that Ratajkowski took her inspiration from Mrs. Claus herself — that is, if Mrs. Claus lived in Tribeca and opted for iced coffee over hot cocoa.</p><p>Ratajkowski is no stranger to wearing furry statement pieces. Take <a href=#>the oversized rust colored fluffy bucket hat</a> that she was spotted wearing in November, for instance. Just as with her fur-trimmed Prada coat, Ratajkowski chose to let the eye-catching accessory pop by pairing it with a more understated all-black outfit. At the time, she tied the look together with a simple leather jacket, crisp black slacks and black sneakers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Emily-Ratajkowski-Gets-in-the-Christmas-Spirit-in-Plaid-Fur-Trimmed-Coat-While-Out-in-NYC.jpg><p>Ratajkowski has also proven that statement pieces can be worn <a href=#>more casually</a>, too. That same month, the My Body author was photographed out in the Big Apple wrapped in <a href=#>a thick gray fuzzy coat</a> that nearly reached her ankles. She kept the rest of her outfit sporty and simple with a pair of black leggings and neon yellow sneakers.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>In a June 2022 interview</a> with Pop Sugar, Ratajkowski revealed that she prioritizes comfort and practicality in her go-to outfit formula.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Definitely sneakers, for sure, and I’ll do a pair of leggings,” she told the publication, revealing that she can’t get enough of flared leggings in particular. “They make me feel a little bit cooler, like very minimally cooler,” she said.</p><p>In the same interview, the model also said that mom jeans are one of her outfit staples. “I often just throw on a crop, a belt, and a sneaker and just make it all about the jeans,” she explained. “Sometimes with an oversized blazer, if you’re going for a Princess Diana moment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5q6qrjYZqmarJGfuLDD0qSgZq%2BVlr%2B0ec%2BlmKKcXZvCs3nTq6CmpZWZeqS7wK1ksKCZobJuu9StZKKmXaPGpHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

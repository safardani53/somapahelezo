She really doesn’t deserve to be abandoned the way she was,” wrote one critic on Reddit.</p><p>Added a second: “It’s all about how hurt he is & how he doesn’t want poor victim Robyn to have to see him in his ‘dark’ mood. He couldn’t even be bothered to wish Savannah or the boys a Merry Christmas.”</p><p>And a third: “Abandoning your child is the ultimate dealbreaker for me. Robyn better take notes that her kids will get this treatment as well at some point.”</p><p>And a fourth: “Kodys punishing Janelle and Christine’s kids because he’s not on good terms with their moms. I’m a single mom and I’ve experienced this, and I know and see many other single mom’s experience this. It’s cruel and selfish.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/73204395-12298019-Down_to_one_wife_TLC_has_released_the_new_trailer_for_Season_18_-a-2_1689306806194-copy.jpg><p>We could go on and on.</p><p>Both Christine and Janelle have stated in the past that they left Kody due to the way he acted toward their sons and daughters.</p><p>“For years I’d say, ‘Your dad loves you. He loves you. He wants to spend time with you,” Christine said in December on a podcast, referring at first to 12-year old Truely, but then adding overall:</p><p>“I’d tell my kids that all of the time, that he’s going to come over. We’re going to have a great time.</p><p>“And after a while, they stopped believing me. And I saw it in their eyes that they didn’t believe me anymore.</p><p>“They did really feel like they had a great connection with him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/sister-wives-071223-3-50737f4a50bf462a9cf4f5003c503170-1024x683.jpg><p>As for Gabriel?</p><p>One of the kids Kody shares with Janelle?</p><p>Heck, he <a href=#>doesn’t even talk to his dad anymore</a>.</p><p>Y</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WGcLfOnbBmmqKkxK95x6KrrGWcpMRuvM6ipa1lkah6onnDmptmrKKWwKmxw2adqKpdmL%2B2sctmq6udkam6prrTZqafZZSWwqi0056paA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Mama you look so gorgeous WOW!”</p><p>Tisdale’s husband, <a href=#><strong>Christopher French</strong></a>, also left a loving comment beneath her photo, which read: “The most beautiful and badass woman in the world 💘.”</p><p>The Frenshe founder announced in September 2020 that <a href=#>she was expecting her first child</a> with the 39-year-old musician.

For so many. Ups and downs, and an emotional roller coaster. I think this day was by far my favorite day EVER! I cried I was so happy,” she wrote of her gender reveal celebration, adding the hashtag “#SheSoFrench.”</p><p>The Masked Dancer judge recently spoke to Us Weekly exclusively about <a href=#>returning to work after giving birth</a>. “They say, like, the first two weeks are hell week,” she said in December 2020. “I’m sure I’ll take a month off, but I’m the type of person that’s a multi-tasker. I love to work.”</p><p>Tisdale explained that she has “no plan” for how long she will be on maternity leave, adding, “I just think I’m very present as a person. … I don’t see myself taking too much time off. I have a lot going on. I really love having my hands in everything.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former child star has been married to French since September 2014. Tisdale previously opened up to Us exclusively about <a href=#>how they make their marriage a priority</a> amid their busy work schedules.</p><p>“It’s crazy to balance everything. But, you know, I think that pretty much every night we hang out, and pretty much on the weekends we’re like, ‘OK, let’s do a specific night where we’ll do a date,’” she explained in January 2019. “We both know what our priorities are. We both know that we’re always each other’s No. 1. So I think that’s really how you balance your relationship with work.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602aYrKCcmsZuwMism5qklWLAtcHNrGSipl2jwqWxjJuYm7Fdl8KuvIypoJxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

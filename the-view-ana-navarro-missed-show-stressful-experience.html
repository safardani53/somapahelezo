This kind woman, Jocelyn Sanchez, found it and took the time to find me and return it to me. I’m on Cloud 9!”</p><p>When Ana was on the show last Friday, she <a href=#>found herself getting irritated</a> with one of her co-hosts, Sunny.</p><p>During Joy’s Banned Books segment, <a href=#>Sunny</a> cut off Ana while she was speaking, in order to tell her something she said she’s tired of hearing.</p><p>Ana began: “Listen, the problem is that politicians, elected officials, like in my state of Florida, which has gone bananas–“</p><p>Before she could get to the main part of what she wanted to say on the topic,&nbsp;Sunny&nbsp;jumped in with a blunt: “That’s why you should move.”</p><p>Looking exasperated,&nbsp;Ana&nbsp;snapped back: “I’m not gonna move. You tell me that all the time and it irritates me! You don’t move, you fight.”</p><p>Trying to get the discussion back on track before the two could argue further,&nbsp;Joy&nbsp;asked Ana to finish her original thought on the topic.</p><p>Last month, it was during a discussion about a movie being banned in Ana's state of Florida that led to&nbsp;<a href=#>Sunny making the same suggestion</a>.</p><p>Ana said, "This has gotten ridiculous," as her co-host&nbsp;Sunny&nbsp;blurted out: "You gotta move."</p><p>It took a few seconds for Ana to react to Sunny's comment, but when she did, she seemed frustrated.</p><p>"I'm not gonna move!" she screeched, before adding: "I'm gonna stay in Florida and I'm gonna fight from there."</p><p>Ana continued ranting: "So don't tell me to move again! People write me and tell me to move..."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I think you'd be happier in New York," mom-of-two Sunny then said calmly as&nbsp;Joy&nbsp;attempted to butt in that time, as well.</p><p>Attempting to explain her outburst, Ana turned to Joy and said: "No, because they tell me that, they tell me to move, I'm not moving!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/ana-view-fans-confused-ana-818820384.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/05min-view-talking-prince-charles-816929737-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYWuAc4SPaKuhnV2rtqbDjJqlmmWelsOivtGoZKaho6iypXnSoaawZaOpv6a%2F0p%2BspWWVrb2mvsiepZydXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

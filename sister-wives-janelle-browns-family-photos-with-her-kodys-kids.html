But she ended up meeting Kody’s dad, and they ended up falling in love and getting married before Kody and I started courting.”</p><p class=p1>As Janelle, who was not raised&nbsp;in a&nbsp;polygamist&nbsp;family, navigated plural marriage with Kody, they&nbsp;welcomed six children together. The couple share&nbsp;sons Logan (born in 1994),&nbsp;Hunter (born in 1997), Robert Garrison (born in 1998) and&nbsp;Gabriel “Gabe” (born in 2001), along with&nbsp;daughters Madison “Maddie” (born in 1995) and Savanah (born in 2004).</p><p class=p1>The Wyoming native also entered into a spiritual marriage with <a href=#><strong>Christine Brown</strong></a> in 1994&nbsp;before they <a href=#>announced their&nbsp;split in November 2021</a>. Kody&nbsp;divorced Meri in September 2014 so that he could legally marry his fourth wife,<a href=#><strong> Robyn Brown</strong></a>, and <a href=#>adopt her three children from a previous relationship</a>. (Kody and Meri <a href=#>called it quits</a> in December 2022,&nbsp;and the businessman <a href=# rel>shares a total of 18 children</a> with his partners.)</p><p class=p1>“Of course I still get jealous,” Janelle <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;exclusively in March 2021</a> of their family’s lifestyle. “But I learned a long time ago [that] you really just have to figure out how to be OK with yourself. You have strengths, and you have blessings and you have opportunities that you’re given … you can’t compare. I just think comparison is, like, the death of plural marriage.”</p><p>Though Janelle revealed in December 2022 that she and Kody had been <a href=#>separated for several months</a>, the two have remained proud supporters of their six kids.</p><p class=p1>“Maddie and I had an event with Plexus this weekend in Phoenix. So the boys drove down and we met for dinner&nbsp;<span class=s1>😀</span>. Happy mama,” the TLC personality captioned a January 2022 <a href=#>Instagram</a> snap&nbsp;with two of her sons and daughters Maddie — who shares <a href=#>two children</a> with husband <a href=#><strong>Caleb Brush</strong></a> — and Savanah.</p><p class=p1>While Janelle loves <a href=#>visiting with her grown children and grandchildren</a>, Kody <a href=#>has had&nbsp;a strained relationship</a> with sons Gabe and Garrison.</p><p class=p1>“[We’re] not good. Not talking,” the TLC patriarch<a href=#> admitted during a February 2022 episode</a> of&nbsp;<i>Sister Wives: One on One</i>. “It’s like <a href=#>one of those relationships</a> where we’ve gotta do a lot of work.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Kody had given his sons an ultimatum about their social lives as <a href=#>the family went into a strict lockdown</a> for the coronavirus pandemic. “They need to realize that they should go and date that girlfriend, that’s fine, but <a href=#>you need to move out of the house</a> so I can be home,” he added.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see Janelle and Kody’s family photos through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwKq%2F056pZq%2BZq7K0ecmapZ6knJp6o77OsKWsZZaWuqq42GanoaekpMBuw8itn2aglad6rLvDsqpmo5mZwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

She also held a small bouquet of snow-colored flowers. The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Morning Show</a>&nbsp;</i>star, for his part, opted for a navy suit. The twosome also <a href=#>wore coordinating rings</a>.</p><p class=p1>Neither Watts nor Crudup, who started dating in 2017, have publicly addressed the current status of their relationship.</p><p class=p1>The duo first met when they <a href=#>played an onscreen married couple</a> on Netflix’s&nbsp;<i>Gypsy.&nbsp;</i>By August 2017,&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>confirmed they were <a href=#>in a real-life relationship</a>. “Naomi and Billy are dating, but in the early stages,” <a href=#>an insider told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>at the time</a>. “They’re very into each other.”</p><p class=p1>As the&nbsp;<i>Infinite Storm&nbsp;</i>star’s romance with Crudup continued to heat up, they fueled <a href=#>speculation that they were engaged</a> earlier this year. Watts stepped out in NYC in April <a href=#>wearing a diamond ring</a> on her left hand. Neither the Stripes founder nor the New York native responded to&nbsp;<i>Us</i>’ request for comment at the time.</p><p class=p1>Months earlier, Watts had opened up to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>about her dynamic with Crudup, including how they celebrated her birthday in September 2022.</p><p class=p1>“I had just a quiet dinner on the actual birthday because it was on a Wednesday,” <a href=#>she exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that October</a>. “Just a school night with the kids and Billy. And then on the weekend, I had some friends over, just [for] drinks and food. It was lovely.”</p><p class=p1>Watts was previously in a long-term relationship with <a href=#><strong>Liev Schreiber</strong></a>, with whom she coparents<a href=#> children Sasha, 15, and Kai, 14</a>. The former couple <a href=#>eventually called it quits in 2016</a> but have since <a href=#>remained supportive coparents</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“It’s always hard, you know? You build a life with someone and things change. And I think the way that we’ve looked at it is that we’ll always be partners and that’s what kind of keeps us together and keeps us amicable,” the 55-year-old&nbsp;<i>Ray Donovan&nbsp;</i>alum — who has moved on with girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Taylor Neisen</strong></a> — said during&nbsp;<a href=#>a January 2018 appearance on<i>&nbsp;Sunday Today With&nbsp;Willie Geist</i></a>. “But I think we’re more than that, I think we also genuinely really care about each other.”</p><p class=p1>Schreiber added at the time: “It’s&nbsp;important to support each other, you know? It’s really important.&nbsp;I was making some jokes this morning at breakfast about mommy <a href=#>with the [kids]</a>, and their eyes light up when I talk about her. You can see how important it is to them that their parents care about each other and that no matter what happens, you continue to try and do that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanmZ%2Bitm7DwK2rrGWSnrmtxYycqa6cpaV6tLzAq6JmpZGnv6qtxp5krKiVmMKtrdOipqdllJrBorXLrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

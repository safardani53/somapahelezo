It's unclear when the video was filmed, or how the video was leaked.</p><h2>How old is she?</h2><p>Raines is reportedly 22-years-old and hails from Atlanta, Georgia, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Height Zone</a>.</p><p>She took to Instagram after the video leaked to explain that she and Portnoy were still friends and that she "plans to continue her daily life without vexation."</p><p>“Some might not approve of the video content but it was entirely consensual and it’s unfortunate that it is no longer private,”&nbsp;Raines wrote on Instagram, “but [Portnoy and I] are still friends with no animosity between us.”</p><p>She added, “I won’t label this a mistake since we have both taken responsibility for it. But the fact that it was leaked and posted without our awareness or consent would be considered the true mistake."</p><h2>What did Dave Portnoy say about the video?</h2><p>Portnoy&nbsp;also addressed the video&nbsp;after stocks in the company that owns Barstool, Penn National Gaming, depleted.</p><p>He addressed the stocks dip on a video on Twitter, saying: “A stock is down because somebody has consensual sex? Are you f****** kidding me? I f***. Who cares?”</p><p>Portnoy, who according to his Twitter bio owns a "ton of Penn Stock", is worth an estimated $120m.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000633285950.jpg><p>He then urged his followers to buy Penn shares while the price was lower.</p><p>“I would jump on this dip and I would f*** it,” he said. “No pun intended.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Speaking to Fox News Business, he labeled the correlation of the stock hit with the release of his sex tape as "dumb."</p><p>"Somebody committing a crime by leaking an old video of sex between two consenting adults seems like a dumb reason for a stock to go down," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>"As far as I know, nobody would exist on Earth without intercourse. And anybody who shared or watched it committed a federal crime. It was never meant for public consumption."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqZmuFc4KQaKqynJ6axm6%2BwKKlnqtdorylsctmm5qulWK9sL7Tp6ayZaOaxW7AwKmcZqSVlrhw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

So, when her 29th birthday rolled around on Monday, October 11, it’s safe to say that she brought out all the stops.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>And of course, she expected her guests to do just the same. “Yes it’s true! The dress code is dancehall! Bring out ya best Caribbean Dancehall looks,” the “WAP” singer, who recently <a href=#>welcomed her second child</a> with husband <a href=#><strong>Offset</strong></a>, wrote via Twitter.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Famous friends took the dress code pretty seriously. And while we’ll dive into their looks later, let’s take a moment to unpack the birthday girl’s fabulous fashion.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>For the evening, Cardi looked ready to party, rocking a chain-link black and gold bra, booty shorts and fishnet nights. As per usual, her bling was out of control, as she was draped in bracelets, rings and stunning Chanel <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The “Bodak Yellow” singer certainly wasn’t the only star to take the dress code seriously.<a href=#><strong> Lizzo</strong></a> made quite the jaw-dropping style statement in a barely-there, completely see-through lilac dress and nipple pasties. Her hair was styled in a high ponytail with butterfly clips throughout.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The skin-baring look obviously caused a stir on social media, with many taking to Twitter to share their obsession with the singer’s glitzy ensemble.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“Oop. Lizzo just crossed my TL and that outfit is dancehall af,” a user wrote. Others were more focused about why the “Juice” singer decided to skip out on shoes for the evening. “Is no one concerned that Lizzo is not wearing shoes at the Cardi B birthday party?”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While the case of the vanishing heels is yet to be solved, let’s unpack some of the other looks from the festivities, shall we? <a href=#><strong>Winnie Harlow</strong></a> rocked a red, yellow and green crocheted number that left little to the imagination. She gave the look Y2K spin, pairing the ensemble with beaded choker necklaces, sock booties and square-frame shades.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The model even took to Instagram Stories to show what was going down inside the venue. To say it looked like a good time would be an understatement. Because from <a href=#><strong>Normani</strong> </a>tearing up the dance floor to each and every guest singing out loud, there’s no doubt that the birthday bash was a good time.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>To see all the over-the-top and barely-there fashion statements from Cardi and her guests, keep scrolling!

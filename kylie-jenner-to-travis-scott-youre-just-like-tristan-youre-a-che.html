It is not true. He did not cheat," his rep says. "He cancelled one show tonight because he is under the weather."</p><p>Scott stuck to this same story, Tweeting late yesterday:</p><p>Buffalo I’m so sorry I can’t perform tonight. I’m under the weather and it fucking sucks! Can’t pull up without full rage. Show rescheduled to March 10 all tix are valid. See u soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Scott and his team can make this claim all they want, but TMZ is a very reliable outlet.</p><p>It has even been accused of having a cozy arrangement with the Kardashians.</p><p>So we can’t imagine they would simply invent this cheating accusation out of nowhere.</p><p>It comes with engagement rumors swirling all around Kylie and Travis; nearly every week, there’s some reason for fans to think they’ve agreed to marry.</p><p>Just consider some of the photos <a href=#>Kylie has recently shared online</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This isn’t random chatter, either. Scott himself has made it clear that he’s interested in becoming Kylie’s husband and in giving their daughter a proper, legal family.</p><p>“We’ll get married soon,” Scott told Rolling Stone late last year, teasing his proposal and making it sound as if he’s confident in the answer Jenner will provide once it happens:</p><p>“I just gotta study up – I gotta propose in a fire way."</p><p>The rapper and the 21-year old got together in the spring of 2017, with most observers assuming it was just some meaningless fling.</p><p>But then Kylie actually got pregnant with Scott’s baby and these same outsiders presumed the stars were merely maintaining the illusion of a strong romance for the sake of their careers.</p><p>It would have looked pretty terrible if they split during the pregnancy or right after Stormi was born, right?</p><p>But the naysayers have been proven wrong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Scott and Jenner are still a couple and actually do seem very much in love.</p><p>"It got to a point where I was like, ‘I need her with me to operate. She’s that one,’" Scott admitted to Rolling Stone, concluding of Kylie at that time:</p><p>"People don’t understand how real my girl is. How ill she is. They have assumptions, bullsh-t ass remarks of what they think is going on. Nah, bro… She’s the coolest motherf-cker of all time."</p><p>That’s great.</p><p>But did you cheat on her, Travis?!?</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>The Kardashians: How Many Babies Will They Crank Out in 2019?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WAcLfYpaCeZZqau6%2Bx0WarqGWkp663tdJmqpynpKl6urvUq5xmoqWowW64yKScZqyinsC1rc1msKitopp6onnCoZxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

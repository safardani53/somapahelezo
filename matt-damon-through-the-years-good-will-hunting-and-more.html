During his childhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with older brother <strong>Kyle Damon</strong>, Matt <a href=#>met his best friend</a> and future costar, <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, when they were 10 and 8 years old, respectively.</p><p>After Matt booked his first-ever film role in 1988’s Mystic Pizza, he and Affleck went on to appear in several projects together — including <a href=#>Field of Dreams</a> and School Ties — before cowriting the film that would launch them into stardom: 1997’s <a href=#>Good Will Hunting</a>.</p><p>“I’ve known him for 35 years, and we grew up together,” Matt told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in July 2016. “We were both in love with the same thing — acting and filmmaking. I think we fed on each other’s obsession during really formative, important years and that bonded us for life.”</p><p>The famous duo took home the 1998 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for their work on the film, which also starred <a href=#>Robin Williams</a> and <a href=#><strong>Minnie Driver</strong></a>, the latter of whom Matt <a href=#>began dating in 1997</a>. Their 1998 split sparked a media frenzy, which Driver compared to a “strange, surreal dream” in a May 2022 interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><p>The actress continued: “My family loved Matt. … It’s so tricky, because it’s not deliberate, <a href=#>he couldn’t have helped</a> how famous he became and how his life was being picked over, in the same way that mine was.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Martian</a> actor later dated <a href=#><strong>Winona Ryder</strong></a> for two years before their 2000 split. Soon after, Matt met his future wife, <a href=#><strong>Luciana Barroso</strong></a>, at a Miami bar in 2003.</p><p>“Matt’s story is that he saw me across the room and there was a light on me,” the former bartender told <a href=#>Vogue Australia</a> in May 2018. “And I’m like, ‘Yeah, it was a nightclub — there were lights everywhere!’”</p><p>The couple <a href=#>tied the knot two years later</a> and became the parents of three girls, welcoming daughters Isabella, Gia and Stella in 2006, 2008 and 2012, respectively. Upon their marriage, Matt also became stepfather to Barroso’s daughter Alexia, whom she welcomed with ex-husband <strong>Arbello Barroso</strong> in 1999.</p><p>Matt and his wife later <a href=#>renewed their vows</a> in a stunning beach ceremony on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia in April 2013.</p><p>His family life aside, the <a href=#>Suburbicon</a> actor has starred in many iconic film franchises over the years, including the <a href=#>Ocean’s</a> and <a href=#>Jason Bourne</a> series. He’s even made several Marvel movie cameos in films such as <a href=#>Thor: Ragnarok</a>, <a href=#>Deadpool 2</a> and <a href=#>Thor: Love and Thunder</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to starring in several more films with Affleck — including Chasing Amy, Dogma, <a href=#>The Last Duel</a> and <a href=#>Air</a> — Matt earned a total of five Oscars nominations throughout his career. He’s scored Best Actor nominations for Good Will Hunting and The Martian, as well as a Best Supporting Actor nod for Invictus. In 2017, he was recognized as a producer with a Best Picture nomination for <a href=#>Manchester by the Sea</a>.</p><p>Scroll below for a look back at Matt’s life and career:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqLA02abmqWfo3q1tNGorKCgXam1pnnYnpirq12cvLCwjLCgpaRdncKvwMinnmaZnpl6rrvRnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

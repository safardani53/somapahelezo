Luckily, this one gave far more flattering results.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>The modern version of Sun In has removed parabens and alcohol, but kept the hydrogen peroxide, lemon juice, aloe barbadensis leaf juice and water of the original.</p><p>Jessica, above, adds: “The lemon scent makes it more akin to kitchen cleaner than fresh citrus fruit.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">It's great - but pricey</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca81d16d-2196-4d88-9e46-c8b597a1080c-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Oribe bright blonde sun lightening mist (£65 for 90ml)</p><p>REBECCA Barnes, 42, from Holloway, North London, says: “My interest was piqued when I came across this reformed mist.</p><p>“I grew up in the Baywatch era, so rocking sun-kissed Californian streaks was always on my beauty wish list.</p><p>“As a natural, medium-toned blonde, I have used Sun In products in the past, but that bright yellow spray often made your hair the same hue.</p><p>“Ditching the bottle, I’ve always relied on £150 cut and dyes with my trusted colourist — setting me back £600 a year. Although this product is pricey, it will save me in the long run.”</p><p>Unlike Sun In, this mist does not include peroxide.</p><p>Founded by Cuban-born American hairdresser Oribe Canales, Oribe’s products are free of sulphates and parabens and are also cruelty-free.</p><p>The mist offers a natural blend of lemon and chamomile to illuminate highlights.</p><p>Rebecca says: “The product can be applied selectively or all over to damp or dry hair. You can then either blow-dry hair or ‘bask in the sun’.</p><p>“I used it daily for a few weeks until the desired illumination was achieved. For the first couple of days I didn’t notice much difference.</p><p>But by day four my hair looked lighter and brighter, like I’d just come back from the salon – or Ibiza.</p><p>“This is a luxury hair lightener which works a treat and smells amazing, but the price might make your eyes water.”</p><p>"The colouring properties are activated by heat, so the instructions say to either blow-dry your hair or head outside and let the sun work its magic.</p><p>“I definitely saw better results with the former. I applied it every day for two weeks, but a couple of times a week would probably work best for long-term use — it’s worth remembering that hydrogen peroxide, a type of bleach, dries out hair.</p><p>“That said, the formula is also enriched with aloe and other botanicals to help nourish and protect, and I did find my tresses were shiny and soft after using it.</p><p>“I noticed a subtle difference right away, but it was after three much more liberal applications that it became really apparent.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Good - with a catch</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000681322574.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>John Frieda Go Blonder controlled lightening spray (£6.99 for 100ml)</p><p>SOPHIE Swietochowski, 28, from Harpenden, Herts, says: “My highlights cost more than my gym membership, phone bill and dentist trips combined.</p><p>So when I spotted great reviews for John Frieda’s spray, it caught my attention.</p><p>“It’s £200 cheaper than the highlights I pay for in the salon.”</p><p>The spray contains hydrogen peroxide to lift the colour. Peroxide can cause dry, brittle hair.</p><p>Hairdresser Brooke Evans of Brooke Evans Ironbridge salon, says: “Sometimes darker hair can be lifted at a low level – but using peroxide at home is risky, it can really damage your hair. If used incorrectly, there’s a big risk of damage.”</p><p>Sophie adds: “I apply the spray, starting with my dark roots then combing the remnants through to the ends.</p><p>"I saw a difference after the third go. By the sixth go, it had really given my blonde tresses a boost.</p><p>“What sets this apart is the way it has toned my locks as well as lightened them. But the hydrogen peroxide has taken its toll on my split ends.</p><p>“Still, for just seven quid the outcome isn’t half bad.”</p><p>“My darker roots were lighter, having taken on a slightly golden hue, and faded into the ombre-style blonde more gracefully.</p><p>“Even some previously brassy streaks of blonde, hidden underneath the top layers of hair, had been lifted, too.</p><p>“The end result was delicate and natural looking, not like the botched tint job I feared.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Not dramatic enough</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000681322556.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Pro:Voke Illuminex Touch of Blonde Lightening Blonde Spray, £4.99, Superdrug</p><p>LAUREN Hill-Roger, 33, from Thanet, Kent, says: “A couple of months ago I forked out £80 for my ‘undone’ balayage ’do.</p><p>“If I can get near enough the same results with a £4.99 bottle, then I’m in. The spray advises applying every two to three days to damp hair, so I did for a couple of weeks and blow-dried my hair after each use.”</p><p>The product contains hydro­­gen peroxide, but no sulphates or silicones.</p><p>Lauren says: “Unlike some hair dyes, the product had a more subtle hairspray smell. Containing chamo­mile extract and being vegan friendly, it also gets a thumbs up for its low-chemical credentials.</p><p>“It’s super easy to apply if you’re a busy mum like myself.</p><p>“I wore it to family BBQs, a farm trip and to the pub. But the result isn’t dramatic.</p><p>"It took out the brassin­ess of my highlights and subtly lightened my hair, making me look like I had spent a week at the beach rather than visiting a salon.</p><p>“I’d suggest using this to highlight dark blonde hair, as it didn’t really have the strength to tackle my darker roots.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ca81d16d-2196-4d88-9e46-c8b597a1080c-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000681322574.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BvaWpuYG2FcLrIp5ytoZWoeqet1aisq6GkmnqprcirZKWhl53BprrEq2SsrZ5itq95yKxkm5mToHqiusNmq5qjmaO0bsDIpKuoo12Xxm6%2F06ippmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

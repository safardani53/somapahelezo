My research also tells me that Travis won. Good for him!)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1465402321-1024x683.jpg><p>So, during the podcast, Jason suggested that their mom was rooting for him — because he and his wife, Kylie, had given her grandchildren.</p><p>The two have three children — 4-year-old Wyatt, 2-year-old Elliotte Ray (that is not a typo), and 9-month-old Bennett.</p><p>Meanwhile, Travis was single at the time, and does not have children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As a result, Travis joked that he needed to “start breeding” in order to match Jason in his mother’s esteem.</p><p>Was he joking? Yes. But he then chose to continue the joke. And you can probably see where Taylor’s stans are finding reasons to frown.</p><p>“To all the breeders out there,” Travis later said on the podcast. “I’m gonna find a breeder, and I’m gonna get kids so that mom can love me again.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1712327170-1024x682.jpg><p>Back in July, Travis Kelce attended Taylor’s jarringly lucrative Eras tour when she made a stop in Kansas City.</p><p>The two later touched base, which apparently led to more touching … sparking dating rumors in early September.</p><p>By late September, Taylor became something of a regular in the stands of his games. She dragged her famous friends along to watch. And many of her fans began grudgingly learning about the sport that he plays.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1712308782-1024x683.jpg><p>Travis’ comments are making the rounds on social media, now that people outside of the sports fandom know who he is.</p><p>“I ain’t a swiftie but don’t have to be one to be weirded out about Travis Kelce calling women ‘breeders,’ that ain’t it dude,” one tweet reads.</p><p>“Forever grateful that Joe Alwyn kept to himself and is private. It’s what makes Travis Kelce’s statements from earlier this year about ‘finding a breeder’ cringe,” another tweeted. “You are free to say what you want but are not free from the consequences of doing so. Women are not objects.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1730837325-1024x724.jpg><p>Obviously, we can all understand that Travis was joking at the time. By all accounts, he’s a decent guy. But it was a cringe joke.</p><p>Many of us who don’t follow sports directly only learn of athletes when they date a celebrity of commit a horrific crime. The former is refreshing, especially when someone seems to be as wholesome as Travis.</p><p>It’s possible that some who are annoyed with Taylor’s continued entanglement with the NFL star simply latched onto his bad joke. Confirmation bias is not vindication, folks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1726245887-1024x689.jpg><p>Meanwhile, whatever Travis’ intentions with Taylor may be, he’s planning for his own future. According to records from the Patent and Trademark Office, the NFL star has recently made five trademark requests.</p><p>He seeks to trademark “Travis Kelce,” “Flight 87,” “Alright Nah,” “KillaTrav,” and “Kelce’s Krunch.” These refer to things like his jersey, his signature catchphrase, and even his Instagram username. And he plans to sell merchandise, including bobbleheads and pins.</p><p>Some speculate that Taylor may have advised him on this. She has, famously, trademarked a lot of things in order to protect her brand and her marketing options.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z%2BcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02admqajYr%2Bmr86io2acn5rAbsDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGaqnp1dnbKzecCsZKGho2Kvs7HEnZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

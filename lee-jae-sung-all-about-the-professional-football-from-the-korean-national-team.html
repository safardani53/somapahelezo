Bundesliga team Holstein Kiel in July 2018.</p><p>He was able to impress with his performance in his debut game, earning the Player of the Matchday award with two assists. He scored the fourth penalty in a 2020-21 DFB Pokal match, and the team went on to reach the DFB Pokal semi-finals for the first time in history, only to be ousted by Borussia Dortmund. Lee signed a three-year deal with Mainz 05 in July 2021. Lee will represent Korea in the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in 2022. This is his second time. He appeared in all three group-stage games after being nominated to South Korea’s team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lee-Jae-sung-1.jpg alt="Lee Jae-sung" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>How does he recharge his batteries?</h2><p>Lee recharges his batteries by spending quality time with his parents, particularly his elder brother’s family in Jeonju. He devotes most of his time to his niece and nephew. He thanks his family, who are also his oldest followers, for their enduring love and ardent support. His father, he claims, is often pointing out things he overlooks and giving him advice, to which he always listens.&nbsp;His father’s presence and counsel are vital sources of nutrition for him.</p><h2>He has experienced racist abuse.</h2><p>Lee, like many other football players, has been the target of racist abuse.&nbsp;His Naver blog article addressing racial harassment and revealing his own experience occurred after Wolverhampton Wanderers filed a complaint with UEFA over the racist abuse Hwang-Hee chan had during a friendly match in Portugal.&nbsp;He felt compelled to address the topic since it is an increasing concern for Korean players, and he expressed his own personal experience.&nbsp;He got his first taste of the game while playing for the German club Holstein Kiel.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lee-Jae-sung-2.jpg alt="Lee Jae-sung" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to him, one of his teammates stepped into a room and began asking what he had been eating, which made him so aware of the smell of garlic that he avoided crowds, stopped eating Korean cuisine, and even began wearing fragrances before heading to training to avoid criticism. He was mocked for his eyes, and he was often urged to open his eyes during training.&nbsp;He also encountered prejudice outside of football. A bunch of inebriated individuals shared rude remarks and insults while traveling across Germany.&nbsp;Noting that racism is not limited to Korean players in Europe, he acknowledged to observing the attitude of Korean players and spectators towards foreign players in the K league while playing in Korea and admitting that he was guilty of how they treated them.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>His net worth is estimated to be in the $3 million range as of December 2023.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Football player</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Lee Jae Sung</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijnp1dn66medKupaBlkaG5bq3BqKytZaSdsm680aidnqujnryvrctmnainpJeurbiMn6mopV2ptaZ5yqipnpmeYruiwMiopZqkXamyormO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

A car (which she later learned had been stolen) was inches away from hitting her and her baby. It was a very traumatic event for her and when she called her husband and asked if he could come outside the home and get her, he told her he couldn't get off his conference call.</p><p>Yet despite her feelings about her marriage to Michael after having their first child, Deena always knew she wanted two kids and still decided to go through with having a second child with Michael, claiming "not even a crumbling marriage was going to stop me."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Deena seemingly wants a divorce, her husband wants to keep trying to save their marriage and has since started going to therapy.

I’ve never been able to find that combination of beach and a sweet that isn’t too sweet. I’ve had to combine three to five scents daily to try to get to where I want to be. My entire life I’ve worn vanilla fragrance so much so that my computer password had vanilla in it. Since High School vanilla has been my thing. Finding a scent that was a combination between a fresh baked cookie and surf wax from the beach is what I’ve always wanted.</p><p class=p1><b>Us: </b>Why the roll-on?</p><p class=p3><span class=s1><b>JF: </b></span>I am a busy woman and constantly on the go from day to night. I was never one to throw a spray bottle of perfume into my bag, it doesn’t seem right to me. I wanted to create something that works on the go as we are all very busy! Whether it’s after work or post workout, it’s in your bag and you can always have My Scent with you.</p><p class=p3><span class=s1><b>Us: </b></span>How do you think fragrance relates to hoops – is it an essential accessory of sorts?</p><p class=p3><span class=s1><b>JF: </b></span>I have been designing jewelry for 17 years. Everybody needs a scent. It felt natural in the evolution of the brand. We’ve gone into lifestyle, expanded into the culinary world, and it felt like an honest direction. I’m trying to really listen to our customer base and there were people that I have met throughout the years that ask what scent I wear. I try to stay true to not only what I like, but what I feel like our customers are looking for. I think fragrance and jewelry are incredibly intertwined and something I want to champion as a brand. We create jewelry that is an extension of personal style, it’s my feeling that our fragrance can do the same thing or even more!</p><p class=p3><span class=s1><b>Us:</b> </span>I love the name – My Scent – it’s your signature fragrance. Have you always been a signature scent person? What fragrances have you worn at different times in your life?</p><p class=p3><span class=s1><b>JF:</b></span> To be honest, I have gone back and forth. When I was in high school, I was wearing more floral fragrances. At one point of my life, I was a Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille girl, but to be perfectly honest it never felt right, and I was always still combining multiple scents. I would find more natural coconut scents that I would then combine with more commercial scents. It was always a combination of different coconut and vanilla scents to make one that felt right for me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Why-Jewelry-Designer-Jennifer-Fishers-Fragrance-Is-as-Addictive-as-Her-Eponymous-Hoops2.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s1><b>Us:</b> </span>What do you think a woman’s fragrance says about her?</p><p class=p3><span class=s1><b>JF:</b> </span>It says everything. Fragrance is even more personal than jewelry. Your scent is like your personal marker. You want to walk into a room and have people not only notice you but also notice what you smell like.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><b>Us: </b>How do you get your scent to last? <span class=s2>Any hacks for applying it?</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s3><b>JF: </b>Because </span>My Scent is made from pure liquid essential oils, it’s hydrating, so it lasts. It gives your skin a smooth feeling. It’s a powerful, long-lasting scent on the skin but it’s not overpowering. I like to apply My Scent to the wrists, the neck, and the back of the knees.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2Byr7rIn5yrZZaewKmx0Wajmq2emLWmv4ymsGark5q7tXnSoZirnaNivaa%2Bxa6knmWYlrCsv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

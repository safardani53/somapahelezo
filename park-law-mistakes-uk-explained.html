UK parkin</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>PARKING is one of the many challenges drivers encounter when they are behind the wheel.</p><p>There is a minefield of rules that motorists must adhere to, with parking banned in a places including reserved spaces and on double yellow lines - but there are a few exceptions that car-owners should familiarise themselves with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000295020838.jpg><h2><strong>When can you park on double yellow lines?</strong></h2><p>Double yellows are usually a definite no-no – but can you ever park on them?</p><p>In general, you must not wait or park on yellow lines during the times of operation – these should be shown on nearby time plates or zone entry signs.</p><p>In&nbsp;some circumstances you may be able to stop double yellows, for example to stop to load or unload heavy goods, but check for any indicated restrictions – these are usually indicated by yellow dashes on the kerb and signage.</p><p>If there are no markings, loading or unloading your vehicle should be visibly continuous.</p><p>In most cases, briefly picking up and dropping off passengers is okay too - as long as you're not blocking any roads, junctions or traffic.</p><p>If you’re disabled and have a Blue Badge, you’re usually fine to park on double yellow lines for up to three hours – as long as your badge is clearly displayed and you’re not causing an obstruction.</p><p>In all cases, check for any nearby signage for exceptions to this.</p><h2><strong>When can you park in a bus stop?</strong></h2><p>Stopping with any part of your vehicle (not just the wheels) on a restricted bus stop is likely to get you a hefty <a href=#>penalty charge</a>.</p><p>Rule 243 of The Highway Code tells road users: “Do not stop of park at or near a bus or tram stop or taxi rank”.</p><p>It’s best to stay well-clear - unless you have important mitigating circumstances.</p><h2><strong>When can you park outside someone’s house?</strong></h2><p>As long as the piece of road you’re parking on is not private, has a dropped kerb, belongs to a <a href=#>resident’s bay</a> or <a href=#>blocks a driveway</a>, you’re not doing anything wrong <a href=#>in the eyes of the law</a>.</p><p>Unless the street is governed by residents' parking permits, any member of the public can park there - as long as they are complying with restrictions, and not causing obstructions.</p><p>The police are keen to remind people that <a href=#>it's not 'your right' to park in front of your house</a> - unless you have a designated parking space.</p><h2 class="article__content article__content--intro">When can you park&nbsp;on zig-zag lines?</h2><p>As a rule, don't park on zig-zags.</p><p>Both yellow and white zig-zag road markings indicate that parking is prohibited and doing so can carry more than just a fine - you can be given penalty points too.</p><p>White zig-zags can be enforced by the council and the police, do not need a sign for enforcement, and you cannot park on them at any time.</p><p>White zig-zag road markings are enforced 24-hours a day, every day.</p><p>On the other hand, yellow zig-zag lines DO need a sign to be legally enforceable.</p><p>Yellow zig-zags that have a sign in place are enforced by the local council and any fine received is a civil matter - not criminal.</p><p>Motorists should take note of any signage and only park on yellow zig-zags outside of the times indicated.</p><p><a href=#>Yellow zig-zags are usually found outside places such as school gates</a>, police and ambulance stations and hospitals.</p><p>If not sign is present the zig-zags cannot be legally enforced.</p><p>Parking on zig-zag lines, especially white zig-zags, if difficult to dispute if a given penalty and few exceptions are given.</p><h2>Can you park on a junction?</h2><p>You must not park opposite or within 10 metres of a junction except in an authorised parking space.</p><p>Government guidance states you must also not park near the brow of a hill or hump bridge, opposite a traffic island or another parked car.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE DRIVING LAWS</h2></p><h2>How you can challenge an unfair parking&nbsp;ticket?</h2><p>No matter who has issued the parking ticket it is possible to fight it if you think you’ve been unfairly charged.</p><p>Despite this, it’s important to keep in mind that the fine may increase if your appeal is unsuccessful.</p><p>If you've been ticketed by the council or police its advisable to pay up unless you have grounds to appeal.</p><p>Here's how to tell if the ticket is a<a href=# rel=noopener> penalty charge notice or a private parking ticket.</a></p><p>The latter is easier to appeal if you believe you've been unfairly charged.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgpRsb2tpX6Wus7eMpZiwZZ2ewLWtyp6qZq2bYrK5vMuaoKedlGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe -

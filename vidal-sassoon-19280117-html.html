He was noted for repopularising a simple, close-cut geometric hairstyle called the bob cut, worn by famous fashion designers including Mary Quant and film stars such as Mia Farrow, Goldie Hawn, Cameron Diaz, Nastassja Kinski and Helen Mirren. His early life was one of extreme poverty, with seven years of his childhood spent in an orphanage. He quit school at age 14, soon holding various jobs in London during World War II. Although he hoped to become a professional football player, he became an apprentice hairdresser at the suggestion of his mother. After developing a reputation for his innovative cuts, he moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, where he opened the first chain of worldwide hairstyling salons, complemented by a line of hair-treatment products. He sold his business interests in the early 1980s and began funding Israeli think tanks with his profits.</p><table class=wikibox readability=7.5><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>January 17, 1928, Hammersmith, London, England</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>May 9, 2012, Los Angeles, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Citizenship</td><td class=wk_value>United Kingdom, United States (from 1972)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Hairstylist, businessman</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Notable work</td><td class=wk_value>Bob cut hairstyle</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>4, including Catya</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Official Website</td><td class=wk_value>http://www.sassoon.com/</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/vidal-sassoon-rwqn-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Stylist Vidal Sassoon was born in England on January 17, 1928.

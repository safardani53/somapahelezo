After all, he is also a proud father of two grown-up children.</p><h2>Rick Stevesâ€™ Children Follow His Footsteps&nbsp;</h2><p>Rick's son, Andy, grew up traveling with his family in Europe. He&nbsp;followed&nbsp;his father as he updated guidebooks, made TV shows, and organized tours.</p><p>It's no surprise that Andy took his father's footsteps&nbsp;and demonstrated the same interest as his father in traveling.</p><p>Now, he is the founder of a&nbsp;travel company, Weekend Student Adventures Europe. He&nbsp;wrote a book comprising his traveling experiences and titled it, "Andy Steves' Europe: City-Hopping on a Budget." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He also runs a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">podcast</a>, interviewing&nbsp;close international friends collaborating with fellow travel entrepreneurs.</p><p>Likewise, Rick's&nbsp;daughter <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jackie</a> also prefers exploring various places in the world.</p><h2>Made Career Through Passion for&nbsp;Travelling</h2><p>Steves had a passion for traveling&nbsp;from an early age. He even taught&nbsp;travel courses through a student-run program&nbsp;of non-credit programs at the University of Washington.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He upgraded his career by publishing general traveling <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">guides</a> for Europe named Europe Through the Back Door in 1980. He then opened a store that gave piano classes and a travel center in Edmonds, Washington.</p><p>The travel guide hosted his first television show, Travels in Europe With <a href=# rel=follow>Rick Steves</a>&nbsp;from 1991 to 1998. Now popular,&nbsp;Rick Steves' Europe&nbsp;was his second show that debuted in 2000. The show reached its&nbsp;eleventh season in late 2020.</p><p>His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">weekly public radio program</a>, Travel with Rick Steves, first aired in 2005 and is still successfully running. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Moreover, he published various guidebooks&nbsp;such as Europe 101: History and Art for Travelers&nbsp;and Travel as a Political Act.</p><p>Besides the books, Steves runs the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">traveling&nbsp;website</a>, which comprises the European vacation for families&nbsp;at reasonable prices.</p><p>On the website, he ensembles tours to include small groups, great guides, central hotels, sightseeing, and memories to last a lifetime. Moreover, he sells traveling accessories such as planning maps, travel bags, and guidebooks. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Motivates Fans To&nbsp;Travel More</h2><p>While viewers find something oddly comforting about turning on a Rick Steves' television special on PBS, Rick has transpired a way to push them out of their comfort zone.</p><p>His book, Travel as a Political Act&nbsp;which has been revised and published in a third edition, encourages people, especially Americans to jump beyond tourist attractions and engage with people they meet.</p><p>The fact is there's nothing like actually getting on an airplane and flying somewhere and hanging out with people who see things differently than you do. It really knocks your ethnocentrism for a loop.&nbsp;</p><p>He even revealed that many Americans went to Disney theme parks or Las Vegas for vacation every time. Then, he asked his fans to increase their appetite for reality.</p><p>Confessing that Americans had the shortest vacations globally, Steves&nbsp;concluded the interview by suggesting they use time smartly.</p><h2>Rick Steves' 'Europe Awaits'</h2><p>Steves, unfortunately, had to take a forced hiatus from his shows thanks to COVID. Being the traveling man he is, that is a hard task in itself.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, just after the mass vaccination programs,&nbsp;he was right back at it with his new show Rick Steves&nbsp;Europe Awaits</p><p>In a June 9, 2021,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Travel + Leisure</a>&nbsp;when asked about what the new show was about, Steves said it was a collection of destinations in Europe that he thought were perfect for post-COVID travel.</p><p>"Places that get us off the beaten path where we can connect with people and traditional lifestyles and beautiful food without dealing with a lot of the crowds that just were crippling before COVID hit," he added.</p><p>We wish him all the luck with his new show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6e2pLeMrKuerpWoeri1xZ5koJmpYrqivtGinJ1ll56%2FrbLRopynnF6dwa64</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The character did not come back, and showrunner <strong>John Wells</strong> revealed how COVID-19 prevented her from being able to be a part of the last episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shameless-emmy-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>‚ÄúEmmy and I had a lot of conversations about it, trying to make it work,‚Äù John told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EW</a>. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been in New York with [husband]<strong> Sam [Esmail]</strong>, where they live, and right about the time where we were talking about putting it all together was when the additional lockdowns kind of hit again, and it just didn‚Äôt feel safe or practical for her to come back. So I think it‚Äôs with a great deal of regret that we couldn‚Äôt do it but it‚Äôs just more minor casualty of our year of COVID.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Possible storylines for Fiona were discussed, but nothing ever actually came to fruition in the writers‚Äô room. However, John did reveal what he thinks Fiona was doing when the show came to an end. ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs down in Florida,‚Äù he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. ‚ÄúWe joked in the room that she ended up getting a job at Disney World, probably in Epcot Center because she would never get a job on the better side. We had a lot of jokes for her but we never actually nailed it down. But she would have a life and be pursuing her own things. That‚Äôs how people move on with their lives.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shameless-emmy-justin-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Since Fiona‚Äôs return never happened, that means fans will never get to know if she ended up with Jimmy-Steve (<strong>Justin Chatwin</strong>) again. When asked about Fiona‚Äôs romantic life, John told THR that the writing team ‚Äúnever worked it out‚Äù who Fiona was with romantically in the end.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I‚Äôm so proud of this cast and am immensely honored to have been a part of a show as unique and impactful as Shameless.
